<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nearly forty years ago, under encouragement from
your venerated predecessor Archbishop Howley, and with the
friendly help of his Librarian Dr. Maitland, I entered upon the
work of collating manuscripts of the Greek New Testament by
examining the copies brought from the East by Professor
Carlyle, and purchased for the Lambeth Library in 1805.
I was soon called away from this employment—ἑκὼν ἀέκοντί γε
θυμῷ—to less congenial duties in that remote county, wherein
long after it was your Grace's happy privilege to refresh the
spirits of Churchmen and Churchwomen, by giving them pious
work to do, and an example in the doing of it. What I have
since been able to accomplish in the pursuits of sacred criticism,
although very much less than I once anticipated, has proved,
I would fain hope, not without its use to those who love Holy
Scripture, and the studies which help to the understanding of
the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the scholars whose sympathy cheered and aided my
Biblical labours from time to time, I have had the honour of
including your Grace; yet it would be at once unseemly and
fallacious to assume from that circumstance, that the principles
of textual criticism which I have consistently advocated have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
approved themselves to your judgement. All that I can look
for or desire in this respect is that I may seem to you to
have stated my case fairly and temperately, in earnest controversy
with opponents far my superiors in learning and dialectic
power, and for whom, in spite of literary differences, I entertain
deep respect and true regard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My Lord, you have been called by Divine Providence to the
first place in our Communion, and have entered upon your
great office attended by the applauses, the hopeful wishes, and
the hearty prayers of the whole Church. May it please God to
endow you richly with the Christian gifts as well of wisdom as
of courage: for indeed the highest minister of the Church of
England, no less than the humblest, will need courage in the
coming time, now that faith is waxing cold and adversaries are
many.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the time of the lamented death of Dr. Scrivener a new
edition of his standard work was called for, and it was supposed
that the great Master of Textual Criticism had himself made
sufficient corrections and additions for the purpose in the margin
of his copy. When the publishers committed to me the task
of preparation, I was fully aware of the absolute necessity of
going far beyond the materials placed at my disposal, if the book
were to be really useful as being abreast of the very great progress
accomplished in the last ten years. But it was not till
I had laboured with absolute loyalty for some months that
I discovered from my own observation, and from the advice
of some of the first textual critics, how much alteration must
at once be made.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Scrivener evidently prepared the Third Edition under
great disadvantage. He had a parish of more than 5,500 inhabitants
upon his hands, with the necessity of making provision for
increase in the population. The result was that after adding
125 pages to his book he had an attack of paralysis, and so
it is not surprising that his work was not wholly conducted
upon the high level of his previous publications. The book has
also laboured under another and greater disadvantage of too
rapid, though unavoidable, growth. The 506 pages of the
First Edition have been successively expanded into 626 pages
in the Second, 751 in the Third, and 874 in the Fourth; while
the framework originally adopted, consisting only of nine
chapters, was manifestly inadequate to the mass of material
ultimately gathered. It has therefore been found necessary, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the work proceeded, to do violence, amidst much delicate
embarrassment, to feelings of loyalty to the author forbidding
alteration. The chief changes that have been made are as
follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first intention of keeping the materials within the
compass of one volume has been abandoned, and it has been
divided into two volumes, with an increase of chapters in each.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of 2,094 manuscripts, as reckoned in the third
edition under the six classes, no less than 3,791 have been
recorded in this edition, being an increase of 236 beyond the
3,555 of Dr. Gregory, without counting the numerous vacant
places which have been filled up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of the accounts of ancient versions have been rewritten
by distinguished scholars, who are leaders in their several
departments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The early part of Volume I has been enriched from the
admirable book on <span class="tei tei-q">“Greek and Latin Palaeography,”</span> by Mr. E.
Maunde Thompson, who with great kindness placed the proof-sheets
at my disposal before publication.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Changes have been made in the headlines, the indexes, and
in the printing, and sometimes in the arrangement, which will,
I trust, enable the reader to find his way more easily about
the treatise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And many corrections suggested by eminent scholars have
been introduced in different places all through the work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A most pleasing duty now is to tender my best thanks to the
Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Salisbury and the Rev. H. J.
White, M.A., for the rewriting of the chapter on Latin Versions
by the latter under Dr. John Wordsworth's supervision, with
help from M. Samuel Berger; to the Rev. G. H. Gwilliam, B.D.,
Fellow of Hertford College, now editing the Peshitto for the
University of Oxford, for the improvement of the passages upon
the Peshitto and the Curetonian; the Rev. H. Deane, B.D., for
additions to the treatment of the Harkleian; and the Rev. Dr.
Walker, Principal of St. John's Hall, Highbury, for the results
of a collation of the Peshitto and Curetonian; to the Rev. A. C.
Headlam, M.A., Fellow of All Souls College, for a revision of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
long chapter upon Egyptian Versions; to F. C. Conybeare, Esq.,
M.A., late Fellow of University College, for rewriting the sections
on the Armenian and Georgian Versions; to Professor
Margoliouth, M.A., Fellow of New College, for rewriting the
sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic Versions; to the Rev. Ll.
J. M. Bebb, M.A., Fellow of Brasenose College, for rewriting the
section upon the Slavonic Version; to Dr. James W. Bright,
Assistant-Professor in the Johns Hopkins University, for rewriting
the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version, through Mr. White's
kind offices; to E. Maunde Thompson, Esq., D.C.L., LL.D., F.S.A.,
&amp;c., for kindness already mentioned, and other help, and to G. F.
Warner, Esq., M.A., of the Manuscript Department of the British
Museum, for correction of some of the notices of cursive MSS.
belonging to the Museum, and for other assistance; to J. Rendel
Harris, Esq., M.A., Fellow of Clare College and Reader in
Palaeology in the University of Cambridge, for much help of a
varied nature; to Professor Isaac H. Hall, Ph.D., of New York
City, for sending and placing at my disposal many of his publications;
to the lamented Professor Bensly, for writing me a letter
upon the Syriac Versions; to the Rev. Nicholas Pocock, M.A.,
of Clifton, for some results of a collation of F and G of St. Paul;
to Professor Bernard, D.D., Trinity College, Dublin, for a paper
of suggestions; to the Rev. Walter Slater, M.A., for preparing
Index II in Vol. I; and to several other kind friends, for assistance
of various kinds freely given. The generosity of scholars
in communicating out of their stores of learning is a most
pleasing feature in the study of the present day. Whatever
may be my own shortcomings—and I fear that they have been
enhanced by limitations of time and space, and through the
effects of ill-health and sorrow—the contributions enumerated
cannot but render the present edition of Dr. Scrivener's great
work eminently useful to students.

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter I. Preliminary Considerations.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. When God was pleased to make known to man His
purpose of redeeming us through the death of His
Son, He employed for this end the general laws, and worked
according to the ordinary course of His Providential government,
so far as they were available for the furtherance of His merciful
design. A revelation from heaven, in its very notion, implies
supernatural interposition; yet neither in the first promulgation
nor in the subsequent propagation of Christ's religion, can we
mark any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">waste</span></em> of miracles. So far as they were needed for the
assurance of honest seekers after truth, they were freely resorted
to: whensoever the principles which move mankind in the affairs
of common life were adequate to the exigences of the case, more
unusual and (as we might have thought) more powerful means
of producing conviction were withheld, as at once superfluous
and ineffectual. Those who heard not Moses and the prophets
would scarcely be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. As it was with respect to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evidences</span></em> of our faith, so
also with regard to the volume of Scripture. God willed that
His Church should enjoy the benefit of His written word, at
once as a rule of doctrine and as a guide unto holy living. For
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this cause He so enlightened the minds of the Apostles and
Evangelists by His Spirit, that they recorded what He had
imprinted on their hearts or brought to their remembrance, without
the risk of error in anything essential to the verity of the
Gospel. But this main point once secured, the rest was left,
in a great measure, to themselves. The style, the tone, the
language, perhaps the special occasion of writing, seem to have
depended much on the taste and judgement of the several penmen.
Thus in St. Paul's Epistles we note the profound thinker,
the great scholar, the consummate orator: St. John pours forth
the simple utterings of his gentle, untutored, affectionate soul:
in St. Peter's speeches and letters may be traced the impetuous
earnestness of his noble yet not faultless character. Their individual
tempers and faculties and intellectual habits are clearly
discernible, even while they are speaking to us in the power and
by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Now this self-same parsimony in the employment of
miracles which we observe with reference to Christian evidences
and to the inspiration of Scripture, we might look for beforehand,
from the analogy of divine things, when we proceed to consider
the methods by which Scripture has been preserved and handed
down to us. God <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em>, if He would, have stamped His revealed
will visibly on the heavens, that all should read it there: He
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em> have so completely filled the minds of His servants the
Prophets and Evangelists, that they should have become mere
passive instruments in the promulgation of His counsel, and the
writings they have delivered to us have borne no traces whatever
of their individual characters: but for certain causes which we
can perceive, and doubtless for others beyond the reach of our
capacities, He has chosen to do neither the one nor the other.
And so again with the subject we propose to discuss in the
present work, namely, the relation our existing text of the New
Testament bears to that which originally came from the hands of
the sacred penmen. Their autographs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em> have been preserved
in the Church as the perfect standards by which all accidental
variations of the numberless copies scattered throughout the
world should be corrected to the end of time: but we know that
these autographs perished utterly in the very infancy of Christian
history. Or if it be too much to expect that the autographs
of the inspired writers should escape the fate which has overtaken
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that of every other known relique of ancient literature,
God <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em> have so guided the hand or fixed the devout attention
both of copyists during the long space of fourteen hundred years
before the invention of printing, and of compositors and printers
of the Bible for the last four centuries, that no jot or tittle
should have been changed of all that was written therein. Such
a course of Providential arrangement we must confess to be
quite possible, but it could have been brought about and maintained
by nothing short of a continuous, unceasing miracle;—by
making fallible men (nay, many such in every generation) for
one purpose absolutely infallible. If the complete identity of all
copies of Holy Scripture prove to be a fact, we must of course
receive it as such, and refer it to its sole Author: yet we may
confidently pronounce beforehand, that such a fact could not
have been reasonably anticipated, and is not at all agreeable to
the general tenour of God's dealings with us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. No one who has taken the trouble to examine any two
editions of the Greek New Testament needs be told that this
supposed complete resemblance in various copies of the holy
books is not founded on fact. Even several impressions derived
from the same standard edition, and professing to exhibit a text
positively the same, differ from their archetype and from each
other, in errors of the press which no amount of care or diligence
has yet been able to get rid of. If we extend our researches to
the manuscript copies of Scripture or of its versions which
abound in every great library in Christendom, we see in the
very best of them variations which we must at once impute to
the fault of the scribe, together with many others of a graver
and more perplexing nature, regarding which we can form no
probable judgement, without calling to our aid the resources of
critical learning. The more numerous and venerable the documents
within our reach, the more extensive is the view we
obtain of the variations (or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">various readings</span></span> as they are
called) that prevail in manuscripts. If the number of these
variations was rightly computed at thirty thousand in Mill's
time, a century and a half ago, they must at present amount
to at least fourfold that quantity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. As the New Testament far surpasses all other remains of
antiquity in value and interest, so are the copies of it yet existing
in manuscript and dating from the fourth century of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
era downwards, far more numerous than those of the most celebrated
writers of Greece or Rome. Such as have been already
discovered and set down in catalogues are hardly fewer than three
thousand six hundred, and more must still linger unknown in the
monastic libraries of the East. On the other hand, manuscripts
of the most illustrious classic poets and philosophers are far
rarer and comparatively modern. We have no complete copy of
Homer himself prior to the thirteenth century, though some considerable
fragments have been recently brought to light which
may plausibly be assigned to the fifth century; while more than
one work of high and deserved repute has been preserved to our
times only in a single copy. Now the experience we gain from
a critical examination of the few classical manuscripts that
survive should make us thankful for the quality and abundance
of those of the New Testament. These last present us with a vast
and almost inexhaustible supply of materials for tracing the
history, and upholding (at least within certain limits) the purity
of the sacred text: every copy, if used diligently and with judgement,
will contribute somewhat to these ends. So far is the
copiousness of our stores from causing doubt or perplexity to the
genuine student of Holy Scripture, that it leads him to recognize
the more fully its general integrity in the midst of partial variation.
What would the thoughtful reader of Aeschylus give for
the like guidance through the obscurities which vex his patience,
and mar his enjoyment of that sublime poet?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. In regard to modern works, it is fortunate that the art
of printing has wellnigh superseded the use of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbal</span></em> or (as
it has been termed) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Textual</span></em> criticism. When a book once
issues from the press, its author's words are for the most part
fixed, beyond all danger of change; graven as with an iron
pen upon the rock for ever. Yet even in modern times, as in
the case of Barrow's posthumous works and Pepys's Diary and
Lord Clarendon's History of the Rebellion, it has been occasionally
found necessary to correct or enlarge the early editions, from
the original autographs, where they have been preserved. The
text of some of our older English writers (Beaumont and
Fletcher's plays are a notable instance) would doubtless have
been much improved by the same process, had it been possible;
but the criticism of Shakespeare's dramas is perhaps the most
delicate and difficult problem in the whole history of literature
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
since that great genius was so strangely contemptuous of the
praise of posterity, that even of the few plays that were
published in his lifetime the text seems but a gathering from
the scraps of their respective parts which had been negligently
copied out for the use of the actors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The design of the science of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Textual criticism</span></span>, as applied
to the Greek New Testament, will now be readily understood.
By collecting and comparing and weighing the variations of the
text to which we have access, it aims at bringing back that
text, so far as may be, to the condition in which it stood in the
sacred autographs; at removing all spurious additions, if such
be found in our present printed copies; at restoring whatsoever
may have been lost or corrupted or accidentally changed in the
lapse of eighteen hundred years. We need spend no time in
proving the value of such a science, if it affords us a fair
prospect of appreciable results, resting on grounds of satisfactory
evidence. Those who believe the study of the Scriptures to be
alike their duty and privilege, will surely grudge no pains when
called upon to separate the pure gold of God's word from the
dross which has mingled with it through the accretions of so
many centuries. Though the criticism of the sacred volume is
inferior to its right interpretation in point of dignity and
practical results, yet it must take precedence in order of time:
for how can we reasonably proceed to investigate the sense of
holy writ, till we have done our utmost to ascertain its precise
language?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. The importance of the study of Textual criticism is
sometimes freely admitted by those who deem its successful
cultivation difficult, or its conclusions precarious; the rather as
Biblical scholars of deserved repute are constantly putting forth
their several recensions of the text, differing not a little from
each other. Now on this point it is right to speak clearly and
decidedly. There is certainly nothing in the nature of critical
science which ought to be thought hard or abstruse, or even
remarkably dry and repulsive. It is conversant with varied,
curious, and interesting researches, which have given a certain
serious pleasure to many intelligent minds; it patiently gathers
and arranges those facts of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> evidence on which alone it
ventures to construct a revised text, and applies them according
to rules or canons of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> evidence, whether suggested by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
experience, or resting for their proof on the plain dictates of
common sense. The more industry is brought to these studies,
the greater the store of materials accumulated, so much the
more fruitful and trustworthy the results have usually proved;
although beyond question the true application even of the
simplest principles calls for discretion, keenness of intellect,
innate tact ripened by constant use, a sound and impartial
judgement. No man ever attained eminence in this, or in any
other worthy accomplishment, without much labour and some
natural aptitude for the pursuit; but the criticism of the Greek
Testament is a field in whose culture the humblest student may
contribute a little that shall be really serviceable; few branches
of theology are able to promise, even to those who seek but
a moderate acquaintance with it, so early and abundant reward
for their pains.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Nor can Textual criticism be reasonably disparaged as
tending to precarious conclusions, or helping to unsettle the
text of Scripture. Even putting the matter on the lowest
ground, critics have not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em> the variations they have discovered
in manuscripts or versions. They have only taught
us how to look ascertained phenomena in the face, and try to
account for them; they would fain lead us to estimate the
relative value of various readings, to decide upon their respective
worth, and thus at length to eliminate them. While we
confess that much remains to be done in this department of
Biblical learning, we are yet bound to say that, chiefly by the
exertions of scholars of the last and present generations, the
debateable ground is gradually becoming narrower, not a few
strong controversies have been decided beyond the possibility of
reversal, and while new facts are daily coming to light, critics of
very opposite sympathies are learning to agree better as to the
right mode of classifying and applying them. But even were
the progress of the science less hopeful than we believe it to be,
one great truth is admitted on all hands;—the almost complete
freedom of Holy Scripture from the bare suspicion of wilful
corruption; the absolute identity of the testimony of every
known copy in respect to doctrine, and spirit, and the main
drift of every argument and every narrative through the entire
volume of Inspiration. On a point of such vital moment I am
glad to cite the well-known and powerful statement of the great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bentley, at once the profoundest and the most daring of English
critics: <span class="tei tei-q">“The real text of the sacred writers does not now (since
the originals have been so long lost) lie in any MS. or edition,
but is dispersed in them all. 'Tis competently exact indeed in
the worst MS. now extant; nor is one article of faith or moral
precept either perverted or lost in them; choose as awkwardly
as you will, choose the worst by design, out of the whole lump
of readings.”</span> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Make your 30,000 [variations] as
many more, if numbers of copies can ever reach that sum: all
the better to a knowing and a serious reader, who is thereby
more richly furnished to select what he sees genuine. But even
put them into the hands of a knave or a fool, and yet with the
most sinistrous and absurd choice, he shall not extinguish the
light of any one chapter, nor so disguise Christianity, but that
every feature of it will still be the same<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>.”</span> Thus hath God's
Providence kept from harm the treasure of His written word,
so far as is needful for the quiet assurance of His church and
people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. It is now time for us to afford to the uninitiated reader
some general notion of the nature and extent of the various
readings met with in manuscripts and versions of the Greek
Testament. We shall try to reduce them under a few distinct
heads, reserving all formal discussion of their respective characters
and of the authenticity of the texts we cite for the next
volume (Chapter XI).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_1" id="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_1" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(1) To begin with variations of the gravest kind. In two,
though happily in only two instances, the genuineness of whole
passages of considerable extent, which are read in our printed
copies of the New Testament, has been brought into question.
These are the weighty and characteristic paragraphs Mark xvi.
9-20 and John vii. 53-viii. 11. We shall hereafter defend
these passages, the first without the slightest misgiving, the
second with certain reservations, as entitled to be regarded
authentic portions of the Gospels in which they stand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_2" id="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(2) Akin to these omissions are several considerable interpolations,
which, though they have never obtained a place in
the printed text, nor been approved by any critical editor, are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supported by authority too respectable to be set aside without
some inquiry. One of the longest and best attested of these
paragraphs has been appended to Matt. xx. 28, and has been
largely borrowed from other passages in the Gospels (see below,
class <a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_9" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>). It appears in several forms, slightly varying from each
other, and is represented as follows in a document as old as the
fifth century:
</p>

We subjoin another paragraph, inserted after Luke vi. 4 in
only a single copy, the celebrated Codex Bezae, now at Cambridge:
<span class="tei tei-q">“On the same day he beheld a certain man working on

(3) A shorter passage or mere clause, whether inserted or not in
our printed books, may have appeared originally in the form of
a marginal note, and from the margin have crept into the text,
through the wrong judgement or mere oversight of the scribe.
Such we have reason to think is the history of 1 John v. 7, the
verse relating to the Three Heavenly Witnesses, once so earnestly
maintained, but now generally given up as spurious. Thus too
Acts viii. 37 may have been derived from some Church Ordinal:
the last clause of Rom. viii. 1 (μὴ κατὰ σάρκα περιπατοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ
κατὰ πνεῦμα) is perhaps like a gloss on τοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ: εἰκῆ
in Matt. v. 22<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> and ἀναξίως in 1 Cor. xi. 29 might have been
inserted to modify statements that seemed too strong: τῇ ἀληθείᾳ
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
μὴ πείθεσθαι Gal. iii. 1 is precisely such an addition as would
help to round an abrupt sentence (compare Gal. v. 7). Some
critics would account in this way for the adoption of the
doxology Matt. vi. 13; of the section relating to the bloody
sweat Luke xxii. 43, 44; and of that remarkable verse,
John v. 4: but we may well hesitate before we assent to their
views.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Or a genuine clause is lost by means of what is technically
called Homoeoteleuton (ὁμοιοτέλευτον), when the clause ends in
the same word as closed the preceding sentence, and the transcriber's
eye has wandered from the one to the other, to the
entire omission of the whole passage lying between them. This
source of error (though too freely appealed to by Meyer and
some other commentators hardly less eminent than he) is
familiar to all who are engaged in copying writing, and is far
more serious than might be supposed prior to experience. In
1 John ii. 23 ὁ ὁμολογῶν τὸν υἱὸν καὶ τὸν πατέρα ἔχει is omitted
in many manuscripts, because τὸν πατέρα ἔχει had ended the
preceding clause: it is not found in our commonly received
Greek text, and even in the Authorized English version is
printed in italics. The whole verse Luke xvii. 36, were it less
slenderly supported, might possibly have been early lost through
the same cause, since vv. 34, 35, 36 all end in ἀφεθήσεται. A safer
example is Luke xviii. 39, which a few copies omit for this
reason only. Thus perhaps we might defend in Matt. x. 23
the addition after φεύγετε εἰς τὴν ἄλλην of κἂν ἐν τῇ ἑτέρᾳ διώκωσιν
ὑμᾶς, φεύγετε εἰς τὴν ἄλλην (ἑτέραν being substituted for the first
ἄλλην), the eye having passed from the first φεύγετε εἰς τήν to the
second. The same effect is produced, though less frequently,
when two or more sentences <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">begin</span></em> with the same words, as in
Matt. xxiii. 14, 15, 16 (each of which commences with οὐαὶ
ὑμῖν), one of the verses being left out in some manuscripts.

(5) Numerous variations occur in the order of words, the sense
being slightly or not at all affected; on which account this
species of various readings was at first much neglected by
collators. Examples abound everywhere: e.g. τὶ μέρος or μέρος
τι Luke xi. 36; ὀνόματι Ἀνανίαν or Ἀνανίαν ὀνόματι Acts ix. 12;
ψυχρὸς οὔτε ζεστός or ζεστὸς οὔτε ψυχρός Apoc. iii. 16. The order
of the sacred names Ἰησοῦς Χριστός is perpetually changed,
especially in St. Paul's Epistles.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(6) Sometimes the scribe has mistaken one word for another,
which differs from it only in one or two letters. This happens
chiefly in cases when the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">uncial</span></em> or capital letters in which the
oldest manuscripts are written resemble each other, except in
some fine stroke which may have decayed through age. Hence
in Mark v. 14 we find ΑΝΗΓΓΕΙΛΑΝ or ΑΠΗΓΓΕΙΛΑΝ; in
Luke xvi. 20 ΗΛΚΩΜΕΝΟΣ or ΕΙΛΚΩΜΕΝΟΣ; so we read Δαυίδ
or Δαβίδ indifferently, as, in the later or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cursive</span></em> character, β and
υ have nearly the same shape. Akin to these errors of the eye
are such transpositions as ΕΛΑΒΟΝ for ΕΒΑΛΟΝ or ΕΒΑΛΛΟΝ,
Mark xiv. 65: omissions or insertions of the same or similar
letters, as ΕΜΑΣΣΩΝΤΟ or ΕΜΑΣΩΝΤΟ Apoc. xvi. 10: ΑΓΑΛΛΙΑΣΘΗΝΑΙ
or ΑΓΑΛΛΙΑΘΗΝΑΙ John v. 35: and the dropping
or repetition of the same or a similar syllable, as ΕΚΒΑΛΛΟΝΤΑΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑ
or ΕΚΒΑΛΛΟΝΤΑΤΑΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑ Luke ix. 49;
ΟΥΔΕΔΕΔΟΞΑΣΤΑΙ or ΟΥΔΕΔΟΞΑΣΤΑΙ 2 Cor. iii. 10; ΑΠΑΞΕΞΕΔΕΧΕΤΟ
or ΑΠΕΞΕΔΕΧΕΤΟ 1 Pet. iii. 20. It is easy to
see how the ancient practice of writing uncial letters without
leaving a space between the words must have increased the risk
of such variations as the foregoing.

<a name="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_7" id="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(7) Another source of error is described by some critics as
proceeding <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex ore dictantis</span></span>, in consequence of the scribe writing
from dictation, without having a copy before him. One is not,
however, very willing to believe that manuscripts of the better
class were executed on so slovenly and careless a plan. It seems
more simple to account for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">itacisms</span></em><a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> or confusion of certain
vowels and diphthongs having nearly the same sound, which
exist more or less in manuscripts of every age, by assuming that
a vicious pronunciation gradually led to a loose mode of orthography
adapted to it. Certain it is that itacisms are much more
plentiful in the original subscriptions and marginal notes of the
writers of mediaeval books, than in the text which they copied
from older documents. Itacisms prevailed the most extensively
from the eighth to the twelfth century, but not by any means
during that period exclusively:—indeed, they are found frequently
in the oldest existing manuscripts. In the most ancient manuscripts
the principal changes are between ι and ει, αι and ε,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though others occur: in later times η ι and ει, η οι and υ, even ο
and ω, η and ε, are used almost promiscuously. Hence it arises
that a very large portion of the various readings brought together
by collators are of this description, and although in the vast
majority of instances they serve but to illustrate the character
of the manuscripts which exhibit them, or the fashion of the age
in which they were written, they sometimes affect the grammatical
form (e.g. ἔγειρε or ἔγειραι Mark iii. 3; Acts iii. 6;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">passim</span></span>: ἴδετε or εἴδετε Phil. i. 30), or the construction (e.g.
ἰάσωμαι or ἰάσομαι Matt. xiii. 15: οὐ μὴ τιμήσῃ or οὐ μὴ τιμήσει
Matt. xv. 5: ἵνα καυθήσωμαι or ἵνα καυθήσομαι 1 Cor. xiii. 3,
compare 1 Pet. iii. 1), or even the sense (e.g. ἑταίροις or ἑτέροις
Matt. xi. 16: μετὰ διωγμῶν or, as in a few copies, μετὰ διωγμόν
Mark x. 30: καυχᾶσθαι δὴ οὐ συμφέρει or καυχᾶσθαι δεῖ; οὐ συμφέρει
2 Cor. xii. 1: ὅτι χρηστὸς ὁ Κύριος or ὅτι χριστὸς ὁ Κύριος
1 Pet. ii. 3). To this cause we may refer the perpetual interchange
of ἡμεῖς and ὑμεῖς, with their oblique cases, throughout
the whole Greek Testament: e.g. in the single epistle of
1 Peter, ch. i. 3; 12; ii. 21 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bis</span></span>; iii. 18; 21; v. 10. Hence we
must pay the less regard to the reading ἡμέτερον Luke xvi. 12,
though found in two or three of our chief authorities: in Acts
xvii. 28 τῶν καθ᾽ ἡμᾶς, the reading of the great Codex Vaticanus
and a few late copies, is plainly absurd. On the other
hand, a few cases occur wherein that which at first sight
seems a mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">itacism</span></em>, when once understood, affords an excellent
sense, e.g. καθαρίζων Mark iii. 19, and may be really the true
form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(8) Introductory clauses or Proper Names are frequently
interpolated at the commencement of Church-lessons (περικοπαί),
whether from the margin of ordinary manuscripts of the Greek
Testament (where they are usually placed for the convenience
of the reader), or from the Lectionaries or proper Service Books,
especially those of the Gospels (Evangelistaria). Thus in our
English Book of Common Prayer the name of Jesus is introduced
into the Gospels for the 14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Sundays
after Trinity; and whole clauses into those for the 3rd and
4th Sundays after Easter, and the 6th and 24th after Trinity<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>.
To this cause may be due the prefix εἶπε δὲ ὁ Κύριος Luke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vii. 31; καὶ στραφεὶς πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς εἶπε Luke x. 22; and
such appellations as ἀδελφοί or τέκνον Τιμόθεε (after σὺ δέ in
2 Tim. iv. 5) in some copies of the Epistles. The inserted
prefix in Greek Lectionaries is sometimes rather long, as in the
lesson for the Liturgy on Sept. 14 (John xix. 6-35). Hence the
frequent interpolation (e.g. Matt. iv. 18; viii. 5; xiv. 22) or
changed position (John i. 44) of Ἰησοῦς. A peculiarity of style
in 1, 2 Thess. is kept out of sight by the addition of Χριστός
in the common text of 1 Thess. ii. 19; iii. 13: 2 Thess.
i. 8, 12.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_9" id="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_9" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(9) A more extensive and perplexing species of various
readings arises from bringing into the text of one of the three
earlier Evangelists expressions or whole sentences which of
right belong not to him, but to one or both the others<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>. This
natural tendency to assimilate the several Gospels must have
been aggravated by the laudable efforts of Biblical scholars
(beginning with Tatian's Διὰ τεσσάρων in the second century)
to construct a satisfactory Harmony of them all. Some of these
variations also may possibly have been mere marginal notes in
the first instance. As examples of this class we will name εἰς
μετάνοιαν interpolated from Luke v. 32 into Mark ii. 17: the
prophetic citation Matt. xxvii. 35 ἵνα πληρωθῇ κ.τ.λ. to the
end of the verse, unquestionably borrowed from John xix. 24,
although the fourth Gospel seldom lends itself to corruptions of
this kind. Mark xiii. 14 τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑπὸ Δανιὴλ τοῦ προφήτου, is
probably taken from Matt. xxiv. 15: Luke v. 38 καὶ ἀμφότεροι
συντηροῦνται from Matt. ix. 17 (where ἀμφότεροι is the true
reading): the whole verse Mark xv. 28 seems spurious, being
received from Luke xxii. 37. Even in the same book we observe
an anxiety to harmonize two separate narratives of the same
event, as in Acts ix. 5, 6 compared with xxvi. 14, 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(10) In like manner transcribers sometimes quote passages
from the Old Testament more fully than the writers of the New
Testament had judged necessary for their purpose. Thus ἐγγίζει
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
μοι ... τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν καί Matt. xv. 8: ἰάσασθαι τοὺς συντετριμμένους

οὐ ψευδομαρτυρήσεις Rom. xiii. 9; ἤ βολίδι κατατοξευθήσεται Heb. xii.
20, and (less certainly) καὶ κατέστησας αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν
σου Heb. ii. 7, are all open to suspicion as being genuine portions
of the Old Testament text, but not also of the New. In Acts xiii.
33, the Codex Bezae at Cambridge stands almost alone in adding
Ps. ii. 8 to that portion of the previous verse which was unquestionably
cited by St. Paul.

<a name="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_11" id="Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(11) Synonymous words are often interchanged, and so form
various readings, the sense undergoing some slight and refined
modification, or else being quite unaltered. Thus ἔφη should be
preferred to εἶπεν Matt. xxii. 37, where εἶπεν of the common
text is supported only by two known manuscripts, that at
Leicester, and one used by Erasmus. So also ὀμμάτων is put for
ὀφθαλμῶν Matt. ix. 29 by the Codex Bezae. In Matt. xxv. 16
the evidence is almost evenly balanced between ἐποίησεν and
ἐκέρδησεν (cf. ver. 17). Where simple verbs are interchanged
with their compounds (e.g. μετρηθήσεται with ἀντιμετρηθήσεται
Matt. vii. 2; ἐτέλεσεν with συνετέλεσεν <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span> ver. 28; καίεται
with κατακαίεται xiii. 40), or different tenses of the same verb
(e.g. εἰληφώς with λαβών Acts xiv. 24; ἀνθέστηκε with ἀντέστη
2 Tim. iv. 15), there is usually some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> reason why one
should be chosen rather than the other, if the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> evidence
on the other side does not greatly preponderate. When one of
two terms is employed in a sense peculiar to the New Testament
dialect, the easier synonym may be suspected of having originated
in a gloss or marginal interpretation. Hence <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caeteris
paribus</span></span> we should adopt δικαιοσύνην rather than ἐλεημοσύνην in
Matt. vi. 1; ἐσκυλμένοι rather than ἐκλελυμένοι ix. 36; ἀθῶον
rather than δίκαιον xxvii. 4.

(12) An irregular, obscure, or incomplete construction will
often be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explained</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supplied</span></em> in the margin by words that are
subsequently brought into the text. Of this character is ἐμέμψαντο
Mark vii. 2; δέξασθαι ἡμᾶς 2 Cor. viii. 4; γράφω xiii. 2;
προσλαβοῦ Philem. 12 (compare ver. 17), and perhaps δῆλον 1 Tim.
vi. 7. More considerable is the change in Acts viii. 7, where the
true reading πολλοὶ ... φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἐξήρχοντο, if translated with
grammatical rigour, affords an almost impossible sense. Or an
elegant Greek idiom may be transformed into simpler language,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as in Acts xvi. 3 ᾔδεισαν γὰρ πάντες ὅτι Ἕλλην ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ὑπῆρχεν
for ᾔδεισαν γὰρ ἅπαντες τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ ὅτι Ἕλλην ὑπῆρχεν:
similarly, τυγχάνοντα is omitted by many in Luke x. 30; compare
also Acts xviii. 26 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fin.</span></span>; xix. 8, 34 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">init.</span></span> The classical μέν
has often been inserted against the best evidence: e.g. Acts
v. 23: xix. 4, 15; 1 Cor. xii. 20; 2 Cor. iv. 12; Heb. vi. 16. On
the other hand a Hebraism may be softened by transcribers, as
in Matt. xxi. 23, where for ἐλθόντι αὐτῷ many copies prefer the
easier ἐλθόντος αὐτοῦ before προσῆλθεν αὐτῷ διδάσκοντι, and in
Matt. xv. 5; Mark vii. 12 (to which perhaps we may add Luke
v. 35), where καί is dropped in some copies to facilitate the sense.
Hence καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι may be upheld before οἱ ποιμένες in Luke
ii. 15. This perpetual correction of harsh, ungrammatical, or
Oriental constructions characterizes the printed text of the
Apocalypse and the recent manuscripts on which it is founded
(e.g. τὴν γυναῖκα Ἰεζαβὴλ τὴν λέγουσαν ii. 20, for ἡ λέγουσα).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(13) Hence too arises the habit of changing ancient dialectic
forms into those in vogue in the transcriber's age. The whole
subject will be more fitly discussed at length hereafter (vol. ii.
c. x.); we will here merely note a few peculiarities of this kind
adopted by some recent critics from the oldest manuscripts,
but which have gradually though not entirely disappeared in
copies of lower date. Thus in recent critical editions Καθαρναούμ,
Μαθθαῖος, τέσσερες, ἔνατος are substituted for Καπερναούμ,
Ματθαῖος, τέσσαρες, ἔννατος of the common text; οὕτως (not οὕτω)
is used even before a consonant; ἤλθαμεν, ἤλθατε, ἦλθαν, γενάμενος
are preferred to ἤλθομεν, ἤλθετε, ἦλθον, γενόμενος: ἐκαθερίσθη, συνζητεῖν,
λήμψομαι to ἐκαθαρίσθη, συζητεῖν, λήψομαι: and ν ἐφελκυστικόν
(as it is called) is appended to the usual third persons of
verbs, even though a consonant follow. On the other hand the
more Attic περιπεπατήκει ought not to be converted into περιεπεπατήκει
in Acts xiv. 8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(14) Trifling variations in spelling, though very proper to be
noted by a faithful collator, are obviously of little consequence.
Such is the choice between καὶ ἐγώ and κἀγώ, ἐάν and ἄν, εὐθέως
and εὐθύς, Μωυσῆς and Μωσῆς, or even between πράττουσι and
πράσσουσι, between εὐδόκησα, εὐκαίρουν and ηὐδόκησα, ηὐκαίρουν.
To this head may be referred the question whether ἀλλά<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>, γε, δέ,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
τε, μετά, παρά &amp;c. should have their final vowel elided or not
when the next word begins with a vowel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(15) A large portion of our various readings arises from the
omission or insertion of such words as cause little appreciable
difference in the sense. To this class belong the pronouns
αὐτοῦ, αὐτῷ, αὐτῶν, αὐτοῖς, the particles οὖν, δέ, τε, and the interchange
of οὐδέ and οὔτε, as also of καί and δέ at the opening of
a sentence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(16) Manuscripts greatly fluctuate in adding and rejecting
the Greek article, and the sense is often seriously influenced
by these variations, though they seem so minute. In Mark ii.
26 ἐπὶ Ἀβιάθαρ ἀρχιερέως <span class="tei tei-q">“in the time that Abiathar was high
priest”</span> would be historically incorrect, while ἐπὶ Ἀβιάθαρ τοῦ
ἀρχιερέως <span class="tei tei-q">“in the days of Abiathar the high priest”</span> is suitable
enough. The article will often impart vividness and reality
to an expression, where its presence is not indispensable: e.g.
Luke xii. 54 τὴν νεφέλην (if τήν be authentic, as looks probable)
is the peculiar cloud spoken of in 1 Kings xviii. 44 as portending
rain. Bishop Middleton's monograph (<span class="tei tei-q">“Doctrine of
the Greek Article applied to the Criticism and Illustration of
the New Testament”</span>), though apparently little known to certain
of our most highly esteemed Biblical scholars, even if its
philological groundwork be thought a little precarious, must
always be regarded as the text-book on this interesting subject,
and is a lasting monument of intellectual acuteness and exact
learning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(17) Not a few various readings may be imputed to the
peculiarities of the style of writing adopted in the oldest manuscripts.
Thus ΠΡΟΣΤΕΤΑΓΜΕΝΟΥΣΚΑΙΡΟΥΣ Acts xvii. 26 may
be divided into two words or three; ΚΑΙΤΑΠΑΝΤΑ ibid. ver. 25,
by a slight change, has degenerated into κατὰ πάντα. The
habitual abridgement of such words as Θεός or Κύριος sometimes
leads to a corruption of the text. Hence possibly comes
the grave variation ΟΣ for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span> 1 Tim. iii. 16, and the singular
reading τῷ καιρῷ δουλεύοντες Rom. xii. 11, where the true word
Κυρίῳ was first shortened into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΚΡΩ</span></span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>, and then read as ΚΡΩ,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Κ being employed to indicate ΚΑΙ in very early times<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>. Or
a large initial letter, which the scribe usually reserved for a
subsequent review, may have been altogether neglected: whence
we have τι for Οτι before στενή Matt. vii. 14. Or overscores, placed
over a letter (especially at the end of a line and word) to
denote ν, may have been lost sight of; e.g. λίθον μέγα Matt.
xxvii. 60 in several copies, for ΜΕΓΑ [with a line over the final Α]. The use of the symbol
[symbol composed of Pi and Rho together], which in the Herculanean rolls and now and then in Codex
Sinaiticus stands for προ and προς indifferently, may have produced
that remarkable confusion of the two prepositions when
compounded with verbs which we notice in Matt. xxvi. 39;
Mark xiv. 35; Acts xii. 6; xvii. 5, 26; xx. 5, 13; xxii. 25. It
will be seen hereafter that as the earliest manuscripts have
few marks of punctuation, breathing or accent, these points
(often far from indifferent) must be left in a great measure to
an editor's taste and judgement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(18) Slips of the pen, whereby words are manifestly lost or
repeated, mis-spelt or half-finished, though of no interest to
the critic, must yet be noted by a faithful collator, as they will
occasionally throw light on the history of some particular copy
in connexion with others, and always indicate the degree of care
or skill employed by the scribe, and consequently the weight
due to his general testimony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great mass of various readings we have hitherto attempted
to classify (to our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> heads we will recur
presently) are manifestly due to mere inadvertence or human
frailty, and certainly cannot be imputed to any deliberate intention
of transcribers to tamper with the text of Scripture.
We must give a different account of a few passages (we are
glad they are only a few) which yet remain to be noticed.

(19) The copyist may be tempted to forsake his proper
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
function for that of a reviser, or critical corrector. He may
simply omit what he does not understand (e.g. δευτεροπρώτῳ
Luke vi. 1; τὸ μαρτύριον 1 Tim. ii. 6), or may attempt to get
over a difficulty by inversions and other changes. Thus the
μυστήριον spoken of by St. Paul 1 Cor. xv. 51, which rightly
stands in the received text πάντες μὲν οὐ κοιμηθησόμεθα, πάντες
δὲ ἀλλαγησόμεθα, was easily varied into πάντες κοιμηθησόμεθα,
οὐ π. δὲ ἀλ., as if in mere perplexity. From this source must
arise the omission in a few manuscripts of υἱοῦ Βαραχίου in
Matt. xxiii. 35; of Ἱερεμίου in Matt. xxvii. 9; the insertion
of ἄλλου ἐκ before θυσιαστηρίου in Apoc. xvi. 7; perhaps the
substitution of τοῖς προφήταις for Ἡσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ in Mark i. 2,
of οὔπω ἀναβαίνω for οὐκ ἀναβαίνω in John vii. 8, and certainly
of τρίτη for ἕκτε in John xix. 14. The variations between Γεργεσηνῶν
and Γαδαρηνῶν Matt. viii. 28, and between Βηθαβαρᾶ
and Βηθανίᾳ John i. 28, have been attributed, we hope and
believe unjustly, to the misplaced conjectures of Origen.

(20) Finally, whatever conclusion we arrive at respecting the
true reading in the following passages, the discrepancy could
hardly have arisen except from doctrinal preconceptions. Matt.
xix. 17 Τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς εἰ μὴ εἶς, ὁ Θεός; or Τί
με ἐρωτᾷς περὶ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ? εἶς ἐστὶν ὁ ἀγαθός: John i. 18 ὁ
μονογενὴς υἱός or μονογενὴς Θεός: Acts xvi. 7 τὸ πνεῦμα with
or without the addition of Ἰησοῦ: Acts xx. 28 τὴν ἐκκλησίαν
τοῦ Θεοῦ or τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ Κυρίου: perhaps also Jude ver. 4
δεσπότην with or without Θεόν. I do not mention Mark xiii. 32
οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός, as there is hardly any authority for its rejection now
extant; nor Luke ii. 22, where τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ αὐτῆς of the
Complutensian Polyglott and most of our common editions is
supported by almost no evidence whatever.

11. It is very possible that some scattered readings cannot
be reduced to any of the above-named classes, but enough has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been said to afford the student a general notion of the nature
and extent of the subject<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>. It may be reasonably thought
that a portion of these variations, and those among the most
considerable, had their origin in a cause which must have
operated at least as much in ancient as in modern times, the
changes gradually introduced after publication by the authors
themselves into the various copies yet within their reach. Such
revised copies would circulate independently of those issued
previously, and now beyond the writer's control; and thus becoming
the parents of a new family of copies, would originate
and keep up diversities from the first edition, without any fault
on the part of transcribers<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>. It is thus perhaps we may best
account for the omission or insertion of whole paragraphs or
verses in manuscripts of a certain class [see above <a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_1" class="tei tei-ref">(1)</a>, <a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_2" class="tei tei-ref">(2)</a>, <a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_3" class="tei tei-ref">(3)</a>];
or, in cases where the work was in much request, for those
minute touches and trifling improvements in words, in construction,
in tone, or in the mere colouring of the style [<a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_5" class="tei tei-ref">(5)</a>, <a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_11" class="tei tei-ref">(11)</a>,
<a href="#Chapter_I_Section_10_Class_12" class="tei tei-ref">(12)</a>], which few authors can help attempting, when engaged on
revising their favourite compositions. Even in the Old Testament,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the song of David in 2 Sam. xxii is evidently an early
draft of the more finished composition, Ps. xviii. Traces of the
writer's <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">curae secundae</span></span> may possibly be found in John v. 3, 4;
vii. 53-viii. 11; xiii. 26; Acts xx. 4, 15; xxiv. 6-8. To this
list some critics feel disposed to add portions of Luke xxi-xxiv.

12. The fullest critical edition of the Greek Testament hitherto
published contains but a comparatively small portion of the
whole mass of variations already known; as a rule, the editors
neglect, and rightly neglect, mere errors of transcription. Such
things must be recorded for several reasons, but neither they,
nor real various readings that are slenderly supported, can
produce any effect in the task of amending or restoring the
sacred text. Those who wish to see for themselves how far the
common printed editions of what is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“textus receptus”</span>
differ from the judgement of the most recent critics, may refer
if they please to the small Greek Testament published in the
series of <span class="tei tei-q">“Cambridge Greek and Latin Texts<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>,”</span> which exhibits
in a thicker type all words and clauses wherein Robert Stephen's
edition of 1550 (which is taken as a convenient standard) differs
from the other chief modifications of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">textus receptus</span></span> (viz.
Beza's 1565 and Elzevir's 1624), as also from the revised texts
of Lachmann 1842-50, of Tischendorf 1865-72, of Tregelles
1857-72, of the Revisers of the English New Testament (1881),
and of Westcott and Hort (1881). The student will thus be
enabled to estimate for himself the limits within which the text
of the Greek Testament may be regarded as still open to
discussion, and to take a general survey of the questions on
which the theologian is bound to form an intelligent opinion.

The New Testament.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the extant Greek manuscripts of the New Testament
supply both the most copious and the purest sources of
Textual Criticism, we propose to present to the reader some
account of their peculiarities in regard to material, form, style of
writing, date and contents, before we enter into details respecting
individual copies, under the several subdivisions to which it is
usual to refer them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The subject of the present section has been systematically
discussed in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Palaeographia Graeca”</span> (Paris, 1708, folio) of
Bernard de Montfaucon [1655-1741<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>], the most illustrious
member of the learned Society of the Benedictines of St. Maur.
This truly great work, although its materials are rather too
exclusively drawn from manuscripts deposited in French libraries,
and its many illustrative facsimiles are somewhat rudely engraved,
still maintains a high authority on all points relating to
Greek manuscripts, even after more recent discoveries, especially
among the papyri of Egypt and Herculaneum, have necessarily
modified not a few of its statements. The four splendid volumes
of M. J. B. Silvestre's <span class="tei tei-q">“Paléographie Universelle”</span> (Paris, 1839-41,
&amp;c. folio) afford us no less than 300 plates of the Greek
writing of various ages, sumptuously executed; though the
accompanying letter-press descriptions, by F. and A. Champollion
Fils, seem in this branch of the subject a little disappointing;
nor are the valuable notes appended to his translation of their
work by Sir Frederick Madden (London, 2 vols. 1850, 8vo)
sufficiently numerous or elaborate to supply the Champollions'
defects. Much, however, may also be learnt from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Herculanensium
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
voluminum quae supersunt”</span> (Naples, 10 tom. 1793-1850,
fol.); from Mr. Babington's three volumes of papyrus
fragments of Hyperides, respectively published in 1850, 1853
and 1858; and especially from the Prolegomena to Tischendorf's
editions of the Codices Ephraemi (1843), Friderico-Augustanus
(1846), Claromontanus (1852), Sinaiticus (1862), Vaticanus
(1867), and those other like publications (e.g. Monumenta sacra
inedita 1846-1870, and Anecdota sacra et profana 1855) which
have rendered his name perhaps the very highest among scholars
in this department of sacred literature. What I have been able
to add from my own observation, has been gathered from the
study of Biblical manuscripts now in England. To these
sources of information may now be added Professor Wattenbach's
<span class="tei tei-q">“Anleitung zur griechischen Palaeographie”</span> second
edition, Leipsic, 1877, Gardthausen's <span class="tei tei-q">“Griechische Palaeographie,”</span>
Leipsic, 1879; Dr. C. R. Gregory's <span class="tei tei-q">“Prolegomena”</span> to the eighth
edition of Tischendorf, and especially the publication of <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Palaeographical Society Greek Testament,”</span> Parts I and II,
Leipsic, 1884, 1891, <span class="tei tei-q">“Facsimiles of Manuscripts and Inscriptions”</span>
edited by E. A. Bond and E. M. Thompson, Parts I-XII,
London, 1873-82, and a Manual on <span class="tei tei-q">“Greek and Latin Palaeography”</span>
from the hands of Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, of
which the proof-sheets have been most kindly placed by the
accomplished author at the disposal of the editor of this work,
and have furnished to this chapter many elements of enrichment.
It may be added, that since manuscripts have been
photographed, all other facsimiles have been put in the shade:
and in this edition references as a rule will be given only to
photographed copies.

2. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">materials</span></em> on which writing has been impressed at
different periods and stages of civilization are the following:—Leaves,
bark, especially of the lime (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">liber</span></span>), linen, clay and
pottery, wall-spaces, metals, lead, bronze, wood, waxen and
other tablets, papyrus, skins, parchment and vellum, and from
an early date amongst the Chinese, and in the West after the
capture of Samarcand by the Arabs in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 704, paper
manufactured from fibrous substances<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>. The most ancient
manuscripts of the New Testament now existing are composed
of vellum or parchment (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">membrana</span></span>), the term vellum being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strictly applied to the delicate skins of very young calves, and
parchment to the integuments of sheep and goats, though the
terms are as a rule employed convertibly. The word parchment
seems to be a corruption of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">charta pergamena</span></span>, a name
first given to skins prepared by some improved process for
Eumenes, king of Pergamum, about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 150. In judging of the
date of a manuscript on skins, attention must be paid to the
quality of the material, the oldest being almost invariably
written on the thinnest and whitest vellum that could be
procured; while manuscripts of later ages, being usually
composed of parchment, are thick, discoloured, and coarsely
grained. Thus the Codex Sinaiticus of the fourth century is
made of the finest skins of antelopes, the leaves being so large,
that a single animal would furnish only two (Tischendorf, Cod.
Frid.-August. Prolegomena, §. 1). Its contemporary, the far-famed
Codex Vaticanus, challenges universal admiration for the
beauty of its vellum: every visitor at the British Museum can
observe the excellence of that of the Codex Alexandrinus of the
fifth century: that of the Codex Claromontanus of the sixth
century is even more remarkable: the material of those purple-dyed
fragments of the Gospels which Tischendorf denominates
N, also of the sixth century, is so subtle and delicate, that some
persons have mistaken the leaves preserved in England (Brit.
Mus. Cotton, Titus C xv) for Egyptian papyrus. Paper made of
cotton<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">charta bombycina</span></span>, called also <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">charta Damascena</span></span> from
its place of manufacture) may have been fabricated in the
ninth<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> or tenth century, and linen paper (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">charta</span></span> proper) as
early as 1242 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>; but they were seldom used for Biblical
manuscripts sooner than the thirteenth, and had not entirely
displaced parchment at the era of the invention of printing,
about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1450. Lost portions of parchment or vellum
manuscripts are often supplied in paper by some later hand;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but the Codex Leicestrensis of the fourteenth century is
composed of a mixture of inferior vellum and worse paper,
regularly arranged in the proportion of two parchment to three
paper leaves, recurring alternately throughout the whole volume.
Like it, in the mixture of parchment and paper, are codd. 233
and Brit. Mus. Harl. 3,161—the latter however not being a
New Testament MS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Although parchment was in occasional, if not familiar, use
at the period when the New Testament was written (τὰ βιβλία,
μάλιστα τὰς μεμβράνας 2 Tim. iv. 13), yet the more perishable
papyrus of Egypt was chiefly employed for ordinary purposes.
This vegetable production had been used for literary purposes
from the earliest times. <span class="tei tei-q">“Papyrus rolls are represented on the
sculptured walls of Egyptian temples.”</span> The oldest roll now
extant is the papyrus Prisse at Paris, which dates from 2500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>,
or even earlier, unless those which have been lately discovered
by Mr. Flinders Petrie reach as far, or even farther, back<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>. The
ordinary name applied in Greek to this material was χάρτης
(2 John 12), though Herodotus terms it βύβλος (ii. 100, v. 58),
and in Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">charta</span></span> (2 Esdr. xv. 2; Tobit vii. 14—Old Latin
Version). Papyrus was in those days esteemed more highly than
skins: for Herodotus expressly states that the Ionians had been
compelled to have recourse to goats and sheep for lack of byblus
or papyrus; and Eumenes was driven to prepare parchment
because the Alexandrians were too jealous to supply him with
the material which he coveted<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>. Indeed, papyrus was used far
beyond the borders of Egypt, and was plentiful in Rome under
the Empire, being in fact the common material among the
Romans during that period: and as many of the manuscripts
of the New Testament must have been written upon so perishable
a substance in the earliest centuries since the Christian era, this
probably is one of the reasons why we possess no considerable
copies from before the second quarter of the fourth century.
Only a few fragments of the New Testament on papyrus remain.
We find a minute, if not a very clear description of the mode of
preparing the papyrus for the scribe in the works of the elder
Pliny (Hist. Nat. xiii. 11, 12). The plant grew in Egypt, also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Syria, and on the Niger and the Euphrates. Mainly under
Christian influence it was supplanted by parchment and vellum,
which had superior claims to durability, and its manufacture
ceased altogether on the conquest of Egypt by the Mohammedans
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 638).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Parchment is said to have been introduced at Rome not
long after its employment by Attalus. Nevertheless, if it had
been in constant and ordinary use under the first Emperors,
we can hardly suppose that specimens of secular writing would
have failed to come down to us. Its increased growth and
prevalence about synchronize with the rise of Constantinopolitan
influence. It may readily be imagined that vellum (especially
that fine sort by praiseworthy custom required for copies of
Holy Scripture) could never have been otherwise than scarce
and dear. Hence arose, at a very early period of the Christian
era, the practice and almost the necessity of erasing ancient
writing from skins, in order to make room for works in which
the living generation felt more interest, especially when clean
vellum failed the scribe towards the end of his task. This
process of destruction, however, was seldom so fully carried
out, but that the strokes of the elder hand might still be traced,
more or less completely, under the more modern writing. Such
manuscripts are called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">codices rescripti</span></span> or palimpsests (παλίμψηστα<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>),
and several of the most precious monuments of sacred
learning are of this description. The Codex Ephraemi at Paris
contains large fragments both of the Old and New Testament
under the later Greek works of St. Ephraem the Syrian: and
the Codex Nitriensis, more recently disinterred from a monastery
in the Egyptian desert and brought to the British Museum,
comprises a portion of St. Luke's Gospel, nearly obliterated,
and covered over by a Syriac treatise of Severus of Antioch
against Grammaticus, comparatively of no value whatever.
It will be easily believed that the collating or transcribing of
palimpsests has cost much toil and patience to those whose
loving zeal has led them to the attempt: and after all the
true readings will be sometimes (not often) rather uncertain,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even though chemical mixtures (of which <span class="tei tei-q">“the most harmless is
probably hydrosulphuret of ammonia”</span>) have recently been applied
with much success to restore the faded lines and letters of these
venerable records.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. We need say but little of a practice which St. Jerome<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>
and others speak of as prevalent towards the end of the fourth
century, that of dyeing the vellum purple, and of stamping
rather than writing the letters in silver and gold. The Cotton
fragment of the Gospels, mentioned above (p. <a href="#Pg023" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>), is one of the
few remaining copies of this kind, as are the newly discovered
Codex Rossanensis and the Codex Beratinus, and it is not unlikely
that the great Dublin palimpsest of St. Matthew owes its present
wretched discoloration to some such dye. But, as Davidson
sensibly observes, <span class="tei tei-q">“the value of a manuscript does not depend
on such things”</span> (Biblical Criticism, vol. ii. p. 264). We care for
them only as they serve to indicate the reverence paid to the
Scriptures by men of old. The style, however, of the pictures,
illustrations, arabesques and initial ornaments that prevail in
later copies from the eighth century downwards, whose colours
and gilding are sometimes as fresh and bright as if laid on but
yesterday<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>, will not only interest the student by tending to
throw light on mediaeval art and habits and modes of thought,
but will often fix the date of the books which contain them
with a precision otherwise quite beyond our reach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The ink found upon ancient manuscripts is of various
colours<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>. Black ink, the ordinary writing fluid of centuries
(μέλαν, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">atramentum</span></span>, &amp;c.) differs in tint at various periods and
in different countries. In early MSS. it is either pure black
or slightly brown; in the Middle Ages it varies a good deal
according to age and locality. In Italy and Southern Europe
it is generally blacker than in the North, in France and Flanders
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is generally darker than in England; a Spanish MS. of
the fourteenth or fifteenth century may usually be recognized
by the peculiar blackness of the ink. Deterioration is observable
in the course of time. The ink of the fifteenth century particularly
is often of a faded grey colour. Inks of green, yellow,
and other colours, are also found, but generally only for
ornamental purposes. Red, either in the form of a pigment
or fluid ink, is of very ancient and common use, being seen even
in early Egyptian papyri. Gold was also used as a writing
fluid at a very early period. Purple-stained vellum MSS. were
usually written upon in gold or silver letters, and ordinary
white vellum MSS. were also written in gold, particularly in
the ninth and tenth centuries, in the reigns of the Carlovingian
kings. Gold writing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a practice</span></em> died out in the thirteenth
century: and writing in silver appears to have ceased contemporaneously
with the disuse of stained vellum. The ancients
used the liquid of cuttle-fish. Pliny mentions soot and gum
as the ingredients of writing-ink. Other later authors add
gall-apples: metallic infusions at an early period, and vitriol
in the Middle Ages were also employed.

7. While papyrus remained in common use, the chief instrument
employed was a reed (κάλαμος 3 John ver. 13, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">canna</span></span>), such as
are common in the East at present: a few existing manuscripts
(e.g. the Codd. Leicestrensis and Lambeth 1350) appear to have
been thus written. Yet the firmness and regularity of the
strokes, which often remain impressed on the vellum or paper
after the ink has utterly gone, seem to prove that in the
great majority of cases the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">stilus</span></span> made of iron, bronze, or other
metal, or ivory or bone, sharp at one end to scratch the letters,
and furnished with a knob or flat head at the other for purposes
of erasure, had not gone wholly out of use. We must add to
our list of Writing materials a bodkin or needle (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">acus</span></span>), by means
of which and a ruler the blank leaf was carefully divided,
generally on the outer side of the skin, into columns and lines,
whose regularity much enhances the beauty of our best copies.
The vestiges of such points and marks may yet be seen deeply
indented on the surface of nearly all manuscripts, those on one
side of each leaf being usually sufficiently visible to guide the
scribe when he came to write on the reverse. The quill pen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
probably came into use with vellum, for which it is obviously
suited. The first notices of it occur in a story respecting
Theodoric the Ostrogoth, and in a passage of Isidore's <span class="tei tei-q">“Origines”</span><a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
(vi. 13).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Little need be said respecting the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> of manuscripts,
which in this particular (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">codices</span></span>) much resemble printed books.
A few are in large folio; the greater part in small folio or
quarto, the prevailing shape being a quarto (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quaternio</span></span> or quire)
whose height but little exceeds its breadth; some are in octavo,
a not inconsiderable number smaller still: and quires of three
sheets or six leaves, and five sheets or ten leaves (Cod. Vaticanus),
are to be met with. In some copies the sheets have marks
in the lower margin of their first or last pages, like the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signatures</span></em>
of a modern volume, the folio at intervals of two, the quarto at
intervals of four leaves, as in the Codex Bezae of the Gospels
and Acts (D), and the Codex Augiensis of St. Paul's Epistles (F).
Not to speak at present of those manuscripts which have a
Latin translation in a column parallel to the Greek, as the
Codex Bezae, the Codex Laudianus of the Acts, and the Codices
Claromontanus and Augiensis of St. Paul, many copies of every
age have two Greek columns on each page; of these the Codex
Alexandrinus is the oldest: the Codex Vaticanus has three
columns on a page, the Codex Sinaiticus four. The unique
arrangement<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> of these last two has been urged as an argument
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for their higher antiquity, as if they were designed to imitate
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rolled</span></em> books, whose several skins or leaves were fastened
together lengthwise, so that their contents always appeared in
parallel columns; they were kept in scrolls which were unrolled
at one end for reading, and when read rolled up at the other.
This fashion prevails in the papyrus fragments yet remaining,
and in the most venerated copies of the Old Testament preserved
in Jewish synagogues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. We now approach a more important question, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">style</span></em>
of writing adopted in manuscripts, and the shapes of the several
letters. These varied widely in different ages, and form the
simplest and surest criteria for approximating to the date of the
documents themselves. Greek characters are properly divided
into <span class="tei tei-q">“majuscules”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“minuscules,”</span> or by a subdivision of the
former, into Capitals, which are generally of a square kind, fitted
for inscriptions on stones like Ε; Uncials, or large letters<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>, and a
modification of Capitals, with a free introduction of curves, and
better suited for writing, like Ε; and Cursives, or small letters,
adapted for the running hand. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Uncial</span></em> manuscripts were written
in what have frequently been regarded as capital letters, formed
separately, having no connexion with each other, and (in the
earlier specimens) without any space between the words, the
marks of punctuation being few: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cursive</span></em> or running hand
comprising letters more easily and rapidly made, those in the
same word being usually joined together, with a complete
system of punctuation not widely removed from that of printed
books. Speaking generally, and limiting our statement to Greek
manuscripts of the New Testament, Uncial letters or the
Literary or Book-hand prevailed from the fourth to the tenth,
or (in the case of liturgical books) as late as the eleventh
century; Cursive letters were employed as early as the ninth
or tenth century, and continued in use until the invention of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
printing superseded the humble labours of the scribe. But
cursive writing existed before the Christian era: and it seems
impossible to suppose that so very convenient a form of penmanship
could have fallen into abeyance in ordinary life, although
few documents have come down to us to demonstrate the truth
of this supposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the broad and palpable distinction between uncial
and cursive letters, persons who have had much experience in the
study of manuscripts are able to distinguish those of either
class from one another in respect of style and character; so that
the period at which each was written can be determined within
certain inconsiderable limits. After the tenth century many
manuscripts bear dates, and such become standards to which
we can refer others resembling them which are undated. But
since the earliest dated Biblical manuscript yet discovered
(Cursive Evan. 481, see below Chap. <a href="#Chapter_VII" class="tei tei-ref">VII</a>) bears the date
May 7, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 835, we must resort to other means for estimating
the age of more venerable, and therefore more important, copies.
By studying the style and shape of the letters on Greek
inscriptions, Montfaucon was led to conclude that the more
simple, upright, and regular the form of uncial letters; the
less flourish or ornament they exhibit; the nearer their breadth
is equal to their height; so much the more ancient they ought
to be considered. These results have been signally confirmed
by the subsequent discovery of Greek papyri in Egyptian tombs
especially in the third century before the Christian era; and
yet further from numerous fragments of Philodemus, of Epicurus,
and other philosophers, which were buried in the ruins of
Herculaneum in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 79 (<span class="tei tei-q">“Fragmenta Herculanensia,”</span> Walter
Scott). The evidence of these papyri, indeed, is even more
weighty than that of inscriptions, inasmuch as workers in stone,
as has been remarked, were often compelled to prefer straight
lines, as better adapted to the hardness of their material,
where writings on papyrus or vellum would naturally flow
into curves.

10. While we freely grant that a certain tact, the fruit of
study and minute observation, can alone make us capable of
forming a trustworthy opinion on the age of manuscripts; it is
worth while to point out the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principles</span></em> on which a true
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
judgement must be grounded, and to submit to the reader a few

The first three plates at the beginning of this volume represent
the Greek alphabet, as found in the seven following monuments:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) The celebrated Rosetta stone, discovered near that place
during the French occupation of Egypt in 1799, and now in the
British Museum. This most important inscription, which in the
hands of Young and Champollion has proved the key to the
mysteries of Egyptian hieroglyphics, records events of no
intrinsic consequence that occurred <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 196, in the reign of
Ptolemy V Epiphanes. It is written in the three several forms
of hieroglyphics, of the demotic or common characters of the
country, and of Greek Capitals, which last may represent the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lapidary</span></em> style of the second century before our era. The
words are undivided, without breathings, accents, or marks of
punctuation, and the uncial letters (excepting [symbol like capital Roman I] for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zeta</span></span>)
approach very nearly to our modern capital type. In shape
they are simple, perhaps a little rude; rather square than
oblong: and as the carver on this hard black stone was obliged
to avoid curve lines whenever he could, the forms of Ε, Ξ and Σ
differ considerably from the specimens we shall produce from
documents described on soft materials. Plate <a href="#Plate_I" class="tei tei-ref">I</a>. No. (1).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) The Codex Friderico-Augustanus of the fourth century,
published in lithographed facsimile in 1846, contains on forty-three
leaves fragments of the Septuagint version, chiefly from
1 Chronicles and Jeremiah, with Nehemiah and Esther complete,
in oblong folio, with four columns on each page. The plates are
so carefully executed that the very form of the ancient letters
and the colour of the ink are represented to us by Tischendorf,
who discovered it in the East. In 1859 the same indefatigable
scholar brought to Europe the remainder of this manuscript,
which seems as old as the fourth century, anterior (as he thinks)
to the Codex Vaticanus itself, and published it in 1862, in
facsimile type cast for the purpose, 4 tom., with twenty pages
lithographed or photographed, at the expense of the Emperor
Alexander II of Russia, to whom the original had been presented.
This book, which Tischendorf calls Codex Sinaiticus, contains,
besides much more of the Septuagint, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the whole New Testament</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

As a kind of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">avant-courier</span></span> to his great work he had previously
put forth a tract entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Notitia Editionis Codicis Bibliorum

The leading features of these manuscripts will be described
in the fourth and fifth chapters. At present we wish to
compare them with each other for the purpose of tracing, as
closely as we may, the different styles and fashions of uncial
letters which prevailed from the fourth to the tenth or eleventh
century of the Christian era. The varying appearance of cursive
manuscripts cannot so well be seen by exhibiting their alphabets,
for since each letter is for the most part joined to the others in
the same word, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">connected</span></em> passages alone will afford us a correct
notion of their character and general features. For the moment
we are considering the uncials only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the Rosetta stone, by its necessary avoiding of curve lines,
gives only a notion of the manner adopted on stone and not in
common writing, it resembles our earliest uncials at least in
one respect, that the letters, being as broad as they are high,
are all capable of being included within circumscribed squares.
Indeed, yet earlier inscriptions are found almost totally destitute
of curves, even Ο and Θ being represented by simple squares,
with or without a bisecting horizontal line (see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg035" class="tei tei-ref">35</a>)<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Herculanean papyri, however (a specimen of which we
have given in Plate <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">iv</a>. No. 10), are much better suited than
inscriptions can be for comparison with our earliest copies of
Scripture<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>. Nothing can well be conceived more elegant than
these simply-formed graceful little letters (somewhat diminished
in size perhaps by the effects of heat) running across the volume,
thirty-nine lines in a column, without capitals or breaks between
the words. There are scarcely any stops, no breathings, accents,
or marks of any kind; only that &gt;, &lt; or [right-pointing triangle] are now and then
found at the end of a line, to fill up the space, or to join a word
or syllable with what follows. A very few abbreviations occur,
such as [symbol like Pi with Rho] in the first line of our specimen, taken from
Philodemus περὶ κακιῶν (Hercul. Volum. Tom. iii. Col. xx.
ll. 6-15), the very manuscript to which Tischendorf compared
his Cod. Friderico-Augustanus (Proleg. § 11). The papyri,
buried for so many ages from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 79 downwards, may probably
be a century older still, since Philodemus the Epicurean was
the contemporary and almost the friend of Cicero<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>. Hence
from three to four hundred years must have elapsed betwixt the
date of the Herculanean rolls and that of our earliest Biblical
manuscripts. Yet the fashion of writing changed but little
during the interval, far less in every respect than in the four
centuries which next followed, wherein the plain, firm, upright
and square uncials were giving place to the compressed, oblong,
ornamented, or even sloping forms which predominate from the
seventh or eighth century downwards. While advising the
reader to exercise his skill on facsimiles of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entire passages</span></em>,
especially in contrasting the lines from Philodemus (No. <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">10</a>) with
those from the oldest uncials of the New Testament (Nos. <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">11-14</a>;
<a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref">17</a>; <a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref">18</a>; <a href="#Plate_VIII" class="tei tei-ref">20</a>; <a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref">24</a>); we purpose to examine the several
alphabets (Nos. <a href="#Plate_I" class="tei tei-ref">1-7</a>) letter by letter, pointing out to the student
those variations in shape which palaeographers have judged the
safest criteria of their relative ages. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alpha</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">xi</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omega</span></span>, are among the best tests for this purpose.

inscriptions, where the cross line is sometimes broken into an angle
with the vertex downwards ([Symbol]). Even on the Rosetta stone the left
limb leans against the upper part of the right limb, but does not
form an angle with its extremity, while the cross line, springing not
far from the bottom of the left limb, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">ascends</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> to meet the right about half
way down. Modifications of this form may be seen in the Herculanean
rolls, only that the cross line more nearly approaches the horizontal,
and sometimes is almost entirely so. The Cod. Frid.-August.</span><a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%"> does not
vary much from this form, but the three generating lines are often
somewhat curved. In other books, while the right limb is quite straight,
the left and cross line form a kind of loop or curve, as is very observable
in the Nitrian fragment R, and often in Codd. Alex., Ephraemi, Bezae,
the newly discovered Rossanensis, and in the Vatican more frequently
still, in all which </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">alpha</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> often approximates to the shape of our English </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

Tischendorf (Proleg. Cod. Sin. p. xxx, 1863) considers it almost peculiar
to the papyri and the Coptic character. Cod. N (which is more recent
than those named above) makes the two lines on the left form a sharp
angle, as do the Cotton fragment of Genesis (see p. </span><a href="#Pg032" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">32</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, note 1) and Cod.
Claromontanus, Plate </span><a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">xiv</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">. No. 41, only that the lines which contain
the angle in this last are very fine. In later times, as the letters
grew tall and narrow, the modern type of A became more marked,
as in the first letter of Arundel 547 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), of about the tenth
century, though the form and thickness seen in the Cod. Claromontanus
continued much in vogue to the last. Yet </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">alpha</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> even in
Cod. Claromontanus and Cotton Genesis occasionally passes from the
angle into the loop, though not so often as in Cod. A and its companions.
Cod. Borgianus (T), early in the fifth century, exaggerated
this loop into a large ellipse, if Giorgi's facsimile may be trusted. In
Cod. Laudianus E of the Acts and Cureton's palimpsest Homer too
the loop is very decided, the Greek and Latin </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in Laud. (No. </span><a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">25</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">)

be as old as the Rosetta stone. The angular shape adopted in Cod. Z

Originally it consisted of a tall
perpendicular line, on the right side of which four straight lines are
so placed as to form two triangles, whereof the vertical line comprises
the bases, while a small portion of that vertical line entirely separates
the triangles ([Symbol]). This ungraceful figure was modified very early,
even in inscriptions. On the Rosetta stone (No. </span><a href="#Plate_I" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">1</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) the triangles are
rounded off into semicircles, and the lower end of the vertical curved.
Yet the shape in manuscripts is not quite so elegant. The lower
curve is usually the larger, and the curves rarely touch each other.

Such are Codd. ANRZ, Rossanensis (sometimes), and the Cotton
Genesis. In the Herculanean rolls the letter comes near the common
cursive β; in some others (as Cod. Rossanensis at times) its shape is
quite like the modern Β. When oblong letters became common, the
top (e.g. in Cod. Bezae) and bottom extremities of the curve ran into
straight lines, by way of return into the primitive shape (see No. </span><a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">36</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">,

it looks like the English R standing on a base (No. </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">9</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, l. 4). But
this specimen rather belongs to the semi-cursive hand of common life,
than to that of books.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Gamma</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> in its simplest form consists of two lines of equal thickness,
the shorter so placed upon the longer, which is vertical, as to
make one right angle with it on the right side. Thus we find it in
the Rosetta stone, the papyrus of Hyperides, the Herculanean rolls,
and very often in Cod. A. The next step was to make the horizontal
line very thin, and to strengthen its extremity by a point, or knob,
as in Codd. Ephraemi (No. </span><a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">24</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), RZ: or the point was thus strengthened
without thinning the line, e.g. Codd. Vatican., Rossanensis, N and
most later copies, such as Harl. 5598 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) or its contemporary
Parham 18 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">36</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). In Cod. Bezae (No. </span><a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">42</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">gamma</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> much resembles
the Latin r.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Delta</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> should be closely scrutinized. Its most ancient shape is an
equilateral triangle, the sides being all of the same thickness ([symbol]).
Cod. Claromontanus, though of the sixth century, is in this instance
as simple as any: the Herculanean rolls, Codd. Vatican., Sinait., and
the very old copy of the Pentateuch at Paris (Colbert) or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Cod. Sarravianus</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">
and Leyden, much resemble it, only that sometimes the
Herculanean sides are slightly curved, and the right descending stroke
of Cod. Vatican, is thickened. In Cod. A begins a tendency to prolong
the base on one or both sides, and to strengthen one or both ends
by points. We see a little more of this in Cod. Rossanensis and in
the palimpsest Homer of the fifth century, published by Cureton. The
habit increases and gradually becomes confirmed in Codd. Ephraemi
(No. </span><a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">24</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), the Vatican Dio Cassius of the fifth or sixth century, in
Cod. R, and particularly in N and E of the Acts (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_II" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">4</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">14</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">25</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">).
In the oblong later uncials it becomes quite elaborate, e.g. Cod. B
of the Apocalypse, or Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_IX" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">21</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">36</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">. On the Rosetta stone and in
the Cod. Bezae the right side is produced beyond the triangle, and
is produced and slightly curved in Hyperides, curved and strongly
pointed in Cod. Z.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Epsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> has its angular form on the Rosetta marble and other inscriptions
in stone; in the oldest manuscripts it consists as an uncial of a
semicircle, from whose centre to the right of it a horizontal radius
is drawn to the concave circumference. Thus it appears in the Herculanean
rolls (only that here the radius is usually broken off before it
meets the circle), in Codd. Frid-August., Vatican., the two Paris
Pentateuchs (Colbert-Leyden fifth century, Coislin. sixth) and the
Cotton Genesis. In Cod. Alex. a slight trace is found of the more
recent practice of strengthening each of the three extremities with
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
knobs, but only the radius at times in Cod. Rossanensis. The custom
increases in Codd. Ephraemi, Bezae, and still more in Codd. NRZ,
wherein the curve becomes greater than a semicircle. In Hyperides
(and in a slighter degree in Cod. Claromon. No. </span><a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">41</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) the shape almost
resembles the Latin </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">e</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. The form of this and the other round letters
was afterwards much affected in the narrow oblong uncials: see Nos,

indeed but the next letter reversed. In manuscripts it receives its
usual modern shape (Z), the ends being pointed decidedly, slightly,
or not at all, much after the manner described for </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. In old

even both the extreme lines (Cod. Z, No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">6</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, and Cod. Augiensis

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Theta</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> deserves close attention. In some early inscriptions it is
found as a square, bisected horizontally ([Symbol]). On the Rosetta stone
and most others (but only in such monuments) it is a circle, with a
strong central </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">point</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. On the Herculanean rolls the central point is
spread into a short horizontal line, yet not reaching the circumference
(No. </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">10</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, l. 8). Thence in our uncials from the fourth to the sixth
century the line becomes a horizontal diameter to a true circle (Codd.
Vatican., Sinait., Codd. ANRZ, Ephraemi, Claromont., Rossanensis,
and Cureton's Homer). In the seventh century the diameter began
to pass out of the circle on both sides: thence the circle came to be
compressed into an ellipse (sometimes very narrow), and the ends of
the minor axis to be ornamented with knobs, as in Cod. B of the
Apocalypse (eighth century), Cod. Augiensis (ninth century), LX of
the Gospels, after the manner of the tenth century (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_IX" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">21</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">,

is quite without them, from the Codex Alexandrinus, the Cotton
Genesis and Paris-Leyden Pentateuch, Cod. Z and the Isaiah included
in it, to the more recent cursives; although in some manuscripts they
are much rarer than in others. By far the most usual practice is to
put two points, but Cod. Ephraemi, in its </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">New</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> Testament portion,
stands nearly alone with the Cotton Genesis (ch. xviii. 9) in exhibiting
the straight line; Cod. Alexandrinus in the Old Testament, but not
in the New, frequently resembles Codd. Ephraemi and the Cotton

two points or a straight line (as in Z's Isaiah) promiscuously over both
vowels, and in Wake 12, a cursive of the eleventh century, the former
frequently pass into the latter in writing. Codd. Borgianus (T) and
Claromont. have but one point; Codd. N and Rossanensis have two for
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">iota</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, one for </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">upsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Kappa</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> deserves notice chiefly because the vertex of the angle
formed by the two inclined lines very frequently does not meet the
perpendicular line, but falls short of it a little to the right: we observe
this in Codd. ANR, Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and later books. The
copies that have strong points at the end of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> &amp;c. (e.g. Codd.

upper limb of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Kappa</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. In Cod. D a fine horizontal stroke runs a little

All our
models (except Harl. 5598, No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), from the Rosetta stone downwards,
have the right limb longer than the left, which thus leans against its
side, but the length of the projection varies even in the same passage
(e.g. No. </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">10</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). In most copies later than the Herculanean rolls and
Cod. Sinaiticus the shorter line is much the thinner, and the longer
slightly curved. In Cod. Z (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">6</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">18</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) the projection is curved
elegantly at the end, as we saw in </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">delta</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Mu</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> varies as much as most letters. Its normal shape, resembling the
English M, is retained in the Rosetta stone and most inscriptions, but at
an early period there was a tendency to make the letter broader, and not
to bring the re-entering or middle angle so low as in English (e.g. Codd.
Vaticanus and Sinaiticus). In Cod. Ephraemi this central angle is
sometimes a little rounded: in Codd. Alex. and Parham 18 the lines
forming the angle do not always spring from the top of the vertical
lines: in Arund. 547 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) they spring almost from their foot,
forming a thick inelegant loop below the line, the letter being rather
narrow: Harl. 5598 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) somewhat resembles this last, only that the
loop is higher up. In the Herculanean rolls (and to a less extent in the
Cotton Genesis) the two outer lines cease to be perpendicular, and lean
outwards until the letter looks much like an inverted W (No. 10). In
the papyrus Hyperides (No. </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">9</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) these outer lines are low curves, and the
central lines rise in a kind of flourish above them. </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Mu</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> assumes this
shape also in Cod. T, and at the end of a line even in Codd. Vaticanus
and Sinaiticus. This form is so much exaggerated in some examples,
that by discarding the outer curves we obtain the shape seen in Cod.
Z (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">6</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">18</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) and one or two others (e.g. Paul M in Harl. 5613,
No. </span><a href="#Plate_XII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">34</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), almost exactly resembling an inverted pi. So also in the
Isaiah of Cod. Z, only that the left side and base line were made by one
stroke of the pen.

the thin cross line does not pass from the top of the left to the bottom of
the right vertical line as in English (N), but only from about half-way
or two-thirds down the left vertical in the Cotton Genesis, Codd. A,
Rossanensis, Harl. 5598 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), and others; in Codd. אNR Parham 18

parallel straight lines, the middle one being the shortest, as in modern
printed Greek: but all our Biblical manuscripts exhibit modifications of
the small printed ξ, such as must be closely inspected, but cannot easily
be described. In the Cotton Genesis this </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">xi</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is narrow and smaller than
its fellows, much like an old English [Symbol: yogh] resting on a horizontal base which
curves downwards: while in late uncials, as B of the Apocalypse, Cod.
Augiensis (l. 13 Scrivener's </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">photographed page</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">), and especially in Parham

awkward, nor does the shape in Cod. Rossanensis much differ from
these. In Cod. E, the Zurich Psalter of the seventh century, and

straight lines joined at top by another horizontal, thinner perhaps but
not much shorter than they. Thus we meet with it on the Rosetta
stone, Codd. R, Vatican., Sinaiticus, Ephraemi, Claromontanus, Laud. of
the Acts, the two Pentateuchs, Cureton's Homer, and sometimes Cod. A
(No. </span><a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">12</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). The fine horizontal line is, however, slightly produced on
both sides in such early documents as the papyri of Hyperides and
Herculaneum, and in the Cotton Genesis, as well as in Cod. A occasionally</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">.
Both extremities of this line are fortified by strong points in
Codd. N and Rossanensis, and mostly in Cod. A, but the left side only
in Cod. Z, and this in Cod. Bezae occasionally becomes a sort of hooked
curve. The later oblong </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">pi</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> was usually very plain, with thick vertical

produced; in Harl. 5598 (No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) slightly produced on both sides; in

slightly pointed, in Codd. Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and others much more.
In Cod. Bezae the horizontal is curved and flourished; in the late uncials
the vertical is very thick, the horizontal fine, and the ends formed into
heavy triangles (e.g. No. </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">).

the strokes being of equal thickness and not running below the line: nor
do they in Hyperides or in Codd. XZ and Augiensis, which have the
upper lines neatly curved (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">6</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">9</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">18</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">38</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). The right limb of many
of the rest is sometimes, but not always curved; the vertical line in
Codd. Vatican. and Sinaiticus drops slightly below the line; in Codd. A,
Ephraemi, Cotton Genesis, Cureton's Homer, Laud. of the Acts and
Rossanensis somewhat more; in others (as Codd. Bezae NR) considerably.
In the subscription to St. Matthew's Gospel, which may be by a somewhat
later hand, a horizontal line crosses the vertical a little below the curved
lines in Cod. Rossanensis. In later uncials (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">36</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) it becomes
a long or awkward Y, or even degenerates into a long V (No. </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">); or, in
copies written by Latin scribes, into Y reversed. We have described
under </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">iota</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> the custom of placing dots, &amp;c. over </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">upsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. But in
Tischendorf's Leipzig II. (fragments from Numbers to Judges of the
seventh or eighth century) </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">upsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> receives two dots, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">iota</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> only one.
Once in Cod. Z (Matt. xxi. 5) and oftener in its Isaiah a convex semicircle,
like a circumflex, stands over </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">upsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Phi</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is a remarkable letter. In most copies it is the largest in the
alphabet, quite disproportionately large in Codd. ZL (Paris 62) and others,
and to some extent in Codd. AR, Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and Claromont.
The circle (which in the Cotton Genesis is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">sometimes</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> still a lozenge, see
above, p. </span><a href="#Pg032" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">32</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, note 1), though large and in some copies even too broad
(e.g. No. </span><a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">18</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), is usually in the line of the other letters, the vertical line
being produced </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">far</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> upwards (Cod. Augiens. and Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">41</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), or downwards
(No. </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">10</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">), or both (No. </span><a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">36</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). On the Rosetta stone the circle is
very small and the straight line short.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Chi</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is a simple transverse cross (Χ) and never goes above or below the
line. The limb that inclines from left to right is in the uncial form
for the most part thick, the other thin (with final points according to the
practice stated for </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">), and this limb or both (as in Cod. Z) a little
curved.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Psi</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is a rare but trying letter. Its oldest form resembled an English
V with a straight line running up bisecting its interior angle. On the
Rosetta stone it had already changed into its present form (Ψ), the curve
being a small semicircle, the vertical rising above the other letters and
falling a little below the line. In the Cotton Genesis </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">psi</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> is rather taller
than the rest, but the vertical line does not rise above the level of the circle.
In Codd. ANR and Rossanensis the under line is prolonged: in R the two
limbs are straight lines making an angle of about 45° with the vertical,
while oftentimes in Hyperides and Cod. Augiensis (Scrivener's </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">photograph</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
ll. 18, 23) they curve </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">downwards</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; the limbs in N and R being strongly
(slightly in Rossanensis) pointed at the ends, and the bottom of the
vertical bevelled as usual. In Cod. B of the Apocalypse, in Evan.
OW</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; vertical-align: super">d</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">Ξ, and even in Hyperides, the limbs (strongly pointed) fall into
a straight line, and the figure becomes a large cross (No. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">). In Evan.
66 the vertical is crossed above the semicircle by a minute horizontal
line.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Omega</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> took the form Ω, even when </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">omicron</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">theta</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> were square;
thus it appears on the Rosetta stone, but in the Hyperides and Herculaneum
rolls it is a single curve, much like the w of English writing, only
that the central part is sometimes only a low double curve (No. </span><a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">10</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, l. 6).
In the Cotton Genesis, Codd. Vatican., Sinaiticus, Alex., Ephraemi, Bezae,
Claromont., Nitriens., Rossanensis, there is little difference in shape,
though sometimes Cod. Vatican. comes near the Herculanean rolls, and
Cod. Alex, next to it: elsewhere their strokes (especially those in the
centre) are fuller and more laboured. Yet in Cod. N it is often but
a plain semicircle, bisected by a perpendicular radius, with the ends of
the curve bent inwards (No. </span><a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">14</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, l. 2). In the late uncials (Nos. </span><a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">7</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">, </span><a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">16</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">) it
almost degenerates into an ungraceful W, while in Cod. Augiensis (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">photograph</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
l. 18) the first limb is occasionally a complete circle.

These details might be indefinitely added to by references to
other codices and monuments of antiquity, but we have employed
most of the principal copies of the Greek Testament, and have
indicated to the student the chief points to which his attention
should be drawn. Three leading principles have perhaps been
sufficiently established by the foregoing examples:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, that the uncials used in writing differ from the capitals
cut in stone by the curved shapes which the writing hand
naturally adopts<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, that the upright uncials of square dimensions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are more ancient than those which are narrow, oblong, or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaning</span></em><a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, that the simpler and less elaborate the style of
writing, the more remote is its probable date.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Copies of a later age occasionally aim at imitating the fashion
of an earlier period, or possibly the style of the older book from
which their text is drawn. But this anachronism of fashion
may be detected, as well by other circumstances we are soon to
mention, as from the air of constraint which pervades the whole
manuscript: the rather as the scribe will now and then fall into
the more familiar manner of his contemporaries; especially
when writing those small letters which our Biblical manuscripts
of all dates (even the most venerable) perpetually crowd into the
ends of lines, in order to save space.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. We do not intend to dwell much on the cursive handwriting.
No books of the Greek Scriptures earlier than the
ninth century in this style are now extant<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>, though it was
prevalent long before in the intercourse of business or common
life. The papyri of Hyperides (e.g. No. <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>) and the Herculanean
rolls, in a few places, show that the process had then commenced,
for the letters of each word are often joined, and
their shapes prove that swiftness of execution was more aimed
at than distinctness. This is seen even more clearly in a
petition to Ptolemy Philometor (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 164) represented in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Paléographie Universelle”</span> (No. 56). The same great work
contains (No. 66) two really cursive charters of the Emperors
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Maurice (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 600) and Heraclius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616). Other instances
of early cursive writing may be found in two Deeds of Sale,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616, and 599, a Manumission in 355, an Official Deed in 233,
a Deed of Sale in 154, in Aristotle on the Constitution of Athens,
about 100, in a Farm Account in 78-79, in a Receipt in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 20,
in the Casati contract in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 114, in a Letter on Egyptian Contracts
in 146, a Treasury Circular in 170, in a Steward's letter
of the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, in various documents of the same
century lying in the British Museum, at Paris, Berlin, Leyden,
and elsewhere, of which the oldest, being amongst the papyri
discovered by Dr. Flinders Petrie at Gurob is referred to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 268,
and the Leyden papyrus to 260<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>. Yet the earliest books of a later
age known to be written in cursive letters are Cod. 481 (Scholz
461, dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 835) the Bodleian Euclid (dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 888) and
the twenty-four dialogues of Plato in the same Library (dated
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 895)<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>. There is reason to believe, from the comparatively
unformed character of the writing in them all, that Burney 19
in the British Museum (from which we have extracted the
alphabet No. 8, Plate <a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref">iii</a>), and the minute, beautiful and
important Codex l of the Gospels at Basle (of which see a
facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_IX" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>), are but little later than the Oxford books,
and may be referred to the tenth century. Books copied after
the cursive hand had become regularly formed, in the eleventh,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, are hard to be distinguished by
the mere handwriting, though they are often dated, or their age
fixed by the material (see p. <a href="#Pg023" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>), or the style of their illuminations.
Colbert. 2844, or 33 of the Gospels (facsim. No. <a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref">39</a>), is
attributed to the eleventh century, and Burney 21 (No. <a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref">15</a>)<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>, is
dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1292, and afford good examples of their respective
dates. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beta</span></span> (l. 1 letter 4), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when joined to other letters</span></em>, is barely

tall forms of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eta</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span> are very graceful, the whole style
elegant and, after a little practice, easily read. Burney 22
(facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref">37</a>) is dated about the same time, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1319, and
the four Biblical lines much resemble Burney 21<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>. In the
fourteenth century a careless style came into fashion, of which
Cod. Leicestrensis (No. <a href="#Plate_XIII" class="tei tei-ref">40</a>) is an exaggerated instance, and
during this century and the next our manuscripts, though not
devoid of a certain beauty of appearance, are too full of arbitrary
and elaborate contractions to be conveniently read. The
formidable list of abbreviations and ligatures represented in
Donaldson's Greek Grammar (p. 20, third edition)<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> originated at
this period in the perverse ingenuity of the Greek emigrants in
the West of Europe, who subsisted by their skill as copyists;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and these pretty puzzles (for such they now are to many a fair
classical scholar), by being introduced into early printed books<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>,
have largely helped to withdraw them from use in modern times.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. We have now to describe the practice of Biblical
manuscripts as regards the insertion of ι forming a diphthong
with the long vowels <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eta</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omega</span></span>, also with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span> long,
whether by being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span>, i.e. written by their side, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span>,
i.e. written under them. In the earliest inscriptions and in the
papyri of Thebes ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span> (the iota not smaller than other
letters) is invariably found. In the petition to Ptolemy
Philometor (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg041" class="tei tei-ref">41</a>) it occurs four times in the first line,
three times in the third: in the fragments of Hyperides it is
perpetually though not always read, even where (especially with
verbs) it has no rightful place, e.g. ετωι και αντιβολωι (facsimile
No. <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>, ll. 3, 4) for αἰτῶ καὶ ἀντιβολῶ. A little before the Christian
era it began to grow obsolete, probably from its being lost in
pronunciation. In the Herculanean Philodemus (the possible
limits of whose date are from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 50 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 79) as in Evann.
556, 604 (Matt. ii. 12, 13), it is often dropped, though more
usually written. In Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus it is
probably not found, and from this period it almost disappears
from Biblical uncials<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a>; in Cureton's Homer, of the fifth or
perhaps of the sixth century, ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span> is sometimes neglected,
but usually inserted; sometimes also ι is placed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></em> Η or Ω,
an arrangement neither neat nor convenient. With the cursive
character ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span> came in again, as may be seen from the
subscriptions in the Bodleian Euclid and Plato (p. 42, note 1).
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">semicursive</span></span> fragment of St. Paul's Epistles in red letters
(M of St. Paul, Plate <a href="#Plate_XII" class="tei tei-ref">xii</a> No. 34), used for the binding of Harleian
5613, contains ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span> twice, but I have tried in vain to verify
Griesbach's statement (Symbol. Crit. ii. p. 166) that it has ι
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“bis tantum aut ter.”</span> I can find no such instance in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these leaves. The cursive manuscripts, speaking generally,
either entirely omit both forms, or, if they give either, far more
often neglect than insert them. Cod. 1 of the Gospels exhibits the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span> ι. Of forty-three codices now in England which have been
examined with a view to this matter, twelve have no vestige of
either fashion, fifteen represent the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascript</span></span> use, nine the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span>
exclusively, while the few that remain exhibit both indifferently<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>.
The earliest cursive copy ascertained to exhibit ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span> is
Matthaei's r (Apoc. 50<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span> [x]), and after that the Cod. Ephesius
(Evan. 71), dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1160. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span> ι came much into vogue
during the fifteenth century, and thus was adopted in printed books.

13. Breathings (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritus</span></span>) and accents<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> were not applied
systematically to Greek Texts before the seventh century. But
a practice prevailed in that and the succeeding century of
inserting them in older manuscripts, where they were absent
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>. That such was done in many instances (e.g.
in Codd. Vatican. and Coislin. 202 or H of St. Paul) appears
clearly from the fact that the passages which the scribe who
retouched the old letters for any cause left unaltered, are
destitute of these marks, though they appear in all other places.
Cod. א exhibits breathings, apparently by the original scribe, in
Tobit vi. 9; Gal. v. 21 only. The case of Cod. Alexandrinus is
less easy. Though the rest of the book has neither breathings
(except a few here and there) nor accents, the first four lines of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">each</span></em> column of the book of Genesis (see facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref">12</a>), which
are written in red, are fully furnished with them. These marks
Baber, who edited the Old Testament portion of Cod. A, pronounced
to be by a second hand (Notae, p. 1); Sir Frederick
Madden, a more competent judge, declares them the work of the
original scribe (Madden's Silvestre, Vol. i. p. 194, note), and
after repeated examination we know not how to dissent from his
view<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>. So too in the Sarravian Pentateuch of the fifth century
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we read ΤΟΝΥΝ [with several symbols written over the Υ] (Lev. xi. 7) by the first hand. The Cureton
palimpsest of Homer also has them, though they are occasionally
obliterated, and some few are evidently inserted by a corrector;
the case is nearly so with the Milan Homer edited by Mai; and
the same must be stated of the Vienna Dioscorides (Silvestre,
No. 62), whose date is fixed by internal evidence to about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
500. In the papyrus fragment of the Psalms, now in the British
Museum, the accents are very accurate, and the work of the
original scribe. These facts, and others like these, may make us
hesitate to adopt the notion generally received among scholars
on the authority of Montfaucon (Palaeogr. Graec. p. 33), that
breathings and accents were not introduced <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span> before
the seventh or eighth century; although up to that period, no
doubt, they were placed very incorrectly, and often omitted
altogether. The breathings are much the more ancient and
important of the two. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritus lenis</span></span> indeed may be a mere
invention of the Alexandrian grammarians of the second or third
century before Christ, but the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritus asper</span></span> is in fact the
substitute for a real letter (H) which appears on the oldest
inscriptions; its original shape being the first half of the H ([symbol like the left half of a Roman capital letter H]),
of which the second half was subsequently adopted for the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lenis</span></span>
([symbol like the right half of a Roman capital H]). This form is sometimes found in manuscripts of about the
eleventh century (e.g. Lebanon, B.M. Addit. 11300 or k<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">scr</span></span>, and
usually in Lambeth 1178 or d<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">scr</span></span>) ed. of 1550, but even in the
Cod. Alexandrinus the comma and inverted comma are several
times substituted to represent the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lenis</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">asper</span></span> respectively
(facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref">12</a>): and at a later period this last was the ordinary,
though not quite the invariable, mode of expressing the breathings.
Aristophanes of Byzantium (keeper of the famous Library
at Alexandria under Ptolemy Euergetes, about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 240), though
probably not the inventor of the Greek accents, was the first to
arrange them in a system. Accentuation must have been
a welcome aid to those who employed Greek as a learned,
though not as their vernacular tongue, and is so convenient and
suggestive that no modern scholar can afford to dispense with its
familiar use: yet not being, like the rough breathing, an essential
portion of the language, it was but slowly brought into
general vogue. It would seem that in Augustine's age [354-430]
the distinction between the smooth and rough breathing in the
manuscripts was just such a point as a careful reader would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mark, a hasty one overlook<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>. Hence it is not surprising that
though these marks are entirely absent both from the Theban
and Herculanean papyri, a few breathings are apparently by the
first hand in Cod. Borgianus or T (Tischendorf, N. T. 1859,
Proleg. p. cxxxi). One rough breathing is just visible in that
early palimpsest of St. John's Gospel, I<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span> or N<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span>. Such as appear,
together with some accents, in the Coislin Octateuch of the
sixth or seventh century, may not the less be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>
because many pages are destitute of them; those of Cod. Claromontanus,
which were once deemed original, are now pronounced
by its editor Tischendorf to be a later addition. Cod. N, the
purple fragment so often spoken of already, exhibits <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ
manu</span></span> over certain vowels a kind of smooth breathing or slight
acute accent, sometimes little larger than a point, but inserted on
no intelligible principle, so far as we can see, and far oftener
omitted entirely. All copies of Scripture which have not been
specified, down to the end of the seventh century, are quite
destitute of breathings and accents. An important manuscript
of the eighth or ninth century, Cod. L or Paris 62 of the Gospels,
has them for the most part, but not always; though often in the
wrong place, and at times in utter defiance of all grammatical
rules. Cod. B of the Apocalypse, however, though of the same
age, has breathings and accents as constantly and correctly as
most. Codices of the ninth century, with the exception of three
written in the West of Europe (Codd. Augiensis or Paul F,
Sangallensis or Δ of the Gospels, and Boernerianus or Paul G,
which will be particularly described afterwards), are all accompanied
with these marks in full, though often set down
without any precise rule, so far as our experience has enabled
us to observe. The uncial Evangelistaria (e.g. Arundel 547;
Parham 18; Harleian 5598), especially, are much addicted to
prefixing the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritus asper</span></span> improperly; chiefly, perhaps, to
words beginning with H, so that documents of that age are but
slender authorities on such points. Of the cursives the general
tendency is to be more and more accurate as regards the accentuation,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the later the date: but this is only a general rule, as some
that are early are as careful, and certain of the latest as
negligent, as can well be imagined. All of them are partial
to placing accents or breathings over both parts of a word compounded
with a preposition (e.g. ἐπὶσυνάξαι), and on the other
hand often drop them between a preposition and its case (e.g.
ἐπάροτρον).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
14. The punctuation in early times was very simple. In the
papyri of Hyperides there are no stops at all, in the Herculanean
rolls exceeding few: Codd. Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (the latter
very rarely by the first hand) have a single point here and there
on a level with the top of the letters, and occasionally a very
small break in the continuous uncials, with or (as always in
Cod. I<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span> of the sixth century) without the point, to denote a pause
in the sense. Codd. A N have the same point a little oftener;
in Codd. C W<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span> (Paris 314) Z and the Cotton Genesis the single
point stands indiscriminately at the head, middle, or foot of the
letters, while in E (Basil. A. N. iii. 12) of the Gospels and B of
the Apocalypse, as in Cod. Marchalianus of the Prophets (sixth
or seventh century), this change in the position of the point
indicates a full-stop, half stop, or comma respectively. In Cod. L,
of the same date as Codd. E and B (Apoc.), besides the full point
we have the comma (::.) and semicolon (::), with a cross also for
a stop. In Codd. Y Θ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span> (of about the eighth century) the single
point has its various powers as in Cod. E, &amp;c., but besides this
are double, treble, and in Cod. Y quadruple, points with different
powers. In late uncials, especially Evangelistaria, the chief
stop is a cross, often in red (e.g. Arund. 547); while in Harleian
5598 [symbol like three ovals] seems to be the note of interrogation<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>. When the continuous
writing came to be broken up into separate words (of
which Cod. Augiensis in the ninth century affords one of the
earliest examples) the single point was intended to be placed
after the last letter of each word, on a level with the middle of
the letters. But even in this copy it is often omitted in parts,
and in Codd. ΔG, written on the same plan, more frequently
still. Our statements refer only to the Greek portions of these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
copies; the Latin semicolon (;) and the note of interrogation (?)
occur in their Latin versions. The Greek interrogation (;) first
occurs about the ninth century, and (,) used as a stop a little later.
The Bodleian Genesis of this date, or a little earlier, uses (,) also
as an interrogative: so in later times B-C. iii. 5 [xii], and Evan.
556 [xii]. In the earliest cursives the system of punctuation
is much the same as that of printed books: the English colon (:)
not being much used, but the upper single point in its stead<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>.
In a few cursives (e.g. Gonville or 59 of the Gospels), this upper
point, set in a larger space, stands also for a full stop: indeed
(·) is the only stop found in Tischendorf's lo<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ti</span></span> or 61 of the Acts
(Brit. Mus. Add. 20,003): while (;) and (·) are often confused in
440 of the Gospels (Cantab. Mm. 6. 9). The English comma,
placed above a letter, is used for the apostrophus, which occurs
in the very oldest uncials, especially at the end of proper names,
or to separate compounds (e.g. απ᾽ ορφανισθεντες in Cod. Clarom.),
or when the word ends in ξ or ρ (e.g. σαρξ᾽ in Cod. B, θυγατηρ᾽
in Codd. Sinait. and A, χειρ᾽ in Cod. A, ὡσπερ᾽ in the Dioscorides,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 500), or even to divide syllables (e.g. συριγ᾿γας in Cod.
Frid.-August., πολ᾿λα, κατεστραμ᾿μενη, αναγ᾿γελι in Cod. Sinaiticus).
In Cod. Z it is found only after αλλ and μεθ, but in Z's
Isaiah it indicates other elisions (e.g. επ). This mark is more
rare in Cod. Ephraemi than in some others, but is used more or
less by all, and is found after εξ, or ουχ, and a few like words,
even in the most recent cursives. In Cod. Bezae and others it
assumes the shape of &gt; rather than that of a comma.

their cases, as very frequently, but by no means invariably, do
the kindred Codd. Augiens., Sangall., and Boerner. Cod. Z
seldom abridges, and all copies often set υἱος in full. A few dots
sometimes supply the place of the line denoting abbreviation
(e.g. θσ [with dots over the letters] Cotton Genesis, ανοσ [with dots over the letters] Colbert. Pentateuch). A straight
line over the last letter of a line, sometimes over any vowel,
indicates N (or also M in the Latin of Codd. Bezae and Claromont.)
in all the Biblical uncials, but is placed only over
numerals in the Herculanean rolls: κ [with tilde below and to the right],
τ [with tilde below and to the right], and less often θ [with tilde below and to the right] for
καί (see p. <a href="#Pg016" class="tei tei-ref">16</a>, note 1), -ται, -θαι are met with in Cod. Sinaiticus
and all later except Cod. Z: [symbol somewhat like Arabic number 8] for ου chiefly in Codd. L,
Augiensis, B of the Apocalypse, and the more recent uncials.
Such <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">compendia scribendi</span></span> as [symbol like Pi with Rho] in the Herculanean rolls (above

(No. <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">11</a> a, l. 4), and a few more even in the Cod. Sinaiticus; in

books they are more numerous and complicated, particularly in
cursive writing. The terminations [small raised circle] for ος, [horizontal line] for ν, [symbol like left single quotation mark] or [symbol like two left quotation marks] for
ον, [symbol like right double quotation mark] for αις, [symbol like tilde] for ων or ω or ως, [symbol like raised small sigma] for ης, [symbol like raised small upsilon] for ου are familiar;

16. Capital letters of a larger size than the rest at the

of high antiquity. Yet even in Codd. Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and
Sarravianus, which is the other part of the Colbert Pentateuch
(in the first most frequently in the earlier portions of the Old
Testament), the initial letter stands a little outside the line of
writing after a break in the sense, whether the preceding line
had been quite filled up or not. Such breaks occur more regularly
in Codex Bezae, as will appear when we come to describe

Moreover, all copies of whatever date are apt to crowd small
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
letters into the end of a line to save room, and if these small
letters preserve the form of the larger, it is reasonable to
conclude that the scribe is writing in a natural hand, not an
assumed one, and the argument for the antiquity of such a document,
derived from the shape of its letters, thus becomes all the
stronger. The continuous form of writing separate words must
have prevailed in manuscripts long after it was obsolete in
common life: Cod. Claromont., whose text is continuous even in
its Latin version, divides the words in the inscriptions and
subscriptions to the several books.

17. The stichometry of the sacred books has next to be
considered. The Greeks and Romans measured the contents of
their MSS. by lines, not only in poetry, but also artificially
in prose for a standard line of fifteen or sixteen syllables,
called by the earliest writers ἔπος, afterwards στίχος<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>. Not
only do Athanasius [d. 373], Gregory Nyssen [d. 396], Epiphanius
[d. 403], and Chrysostom [d. 407] inform us that
in their time the Book of Psalms was already divided
into στίχοι, while Jerome [d. 420?] testifies the same for the
prophecies of Isaiah; but Origen also [d. 254] speaks of the
second and third Epistles of St. John as both of them not
exceeding one hundred στίχοι, of St. Paul's Epistles as consisting
of few, St. John's first Epistle as of very few (Euseb. Hist. Eccles.
vi. 25, cited by Tischendorf, Cod. Sinait., Proleg. p. xxi, note 2,
1863). Even the apocryphal letter of our Lord to Abgarus is
described as ὀλιγοστίχου μέν, πολυδυνάμου δὲ ἐπιστολῆς (Euseb.
H. E. i. 13): while Eustathius of Antioch in the fourth century
reckoned 135 στίχοι between John viii. 59 and x. 41. More
general is the use of the word in Ephraem the Syrian [d. 378],
Ὅταν δὲ ἀναγινώσκῃς, ἐπιμελῶς καὶ ἐμπόνως ἀναγίνωσκε, ἐν πολλῇ
καταστάσει διερχόμενος τὸν στίχον (tom. iii. 101). As regards the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Psalms, we may see their arrangement for ourselves in Codd.
Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, wherein, according to the true principles
of Hebrew poetry, the verses do not correspond in metre
or quantity of syllables, but in the parallelism or relationship
subsisting between the several members of the same sentence or
stanza<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>. Such στίχοι were therefore not <span class="tei tei-q">“space-lines,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“sense-lines.”</span>
It seems to have occurred to Euthalius, a deacon of
Alexandria, as it did long afterwards to Bishop Jebb when he
wrote his <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Literature,”</span> that a large portion of the New
Testament might be divided into στίχοι on the same principles:
and that even where that distribution should prove but artificial,
it would guide the public reader in the management of his voice,
and remove the necessity for an elaborate system of punctuation.
Such, therefore, we conceive to be the use and design of
stichometry, as applied to the Greek Testament by Euthalius<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>,
whose edition of the Acts and Epistles was published <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 490.
Who distributed the στίχοι of the Gospels (which are in truth
better suited for such a process than the Epistles) does not
appear. Although but few manuscripts now exist that are
written στοιχηδόν or στιχηρῶς (a plan which consumed too much
vellum to become general), we read in many copies, added usually
to the subscription at the foot of each of the books of the New
Testament, a calculation of the number of στίχοι it contained,
the numbers being sufficiently unlike to show that the arrangement
was not the same in all codices, yet near enough to prove
that they were divided on the same principle<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>. In the few documents
written στιχηρῶς that survive, the length of the clauses is
very unequal; some (e.g. Cod. Bezae, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> the description below
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the facsimile, No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>) containing as much in a line as might
be conveniently read aloud in a breath, others (e.g. Cod. Laud. of
the Acts, Plate <a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref">x</a>. No. 25) having only one or two words in a line.
The Cod. Claromontanus (facsim. No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">41</a>) in this respect lies
between those extremes, and the fourth great example of this
class (Cod. Coislin. 202, H of St. Paul), of the sixth century, has
one of its few surviving pages (of sixteen lines each) arranged
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">literatim</span></span> as follows (1 Cor. x. 22, &amp;c.): εσμεν | παντα μοι εξεστι |
αλλ ου παντα συμφερει | παντα μοι εξεστιν | αλλ ου παντα οικοδομει |
μηδεισ το εαυτου ζη | (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ob necessitatem spatii</span></span>) τειτω | αλλα το του

μηδεν ανα | κρινωντες δια την | συνειδησιν | του γαρ κυ η γη και
το πλη | ρωμα αυτης. Other manuscripts written στιχηρῶς are
Matthaei's V of the eighth century (though with verses like
ours more than with ordinary στίχοι), Bengel's Uffenbach 3 of
St. John (Evan. 101), Alter's Forlos. 29 (36 of the Apocalypse),
and, as it would seem, the Cod. Sangallensis Δ. In Cod.
Claromontanus there are scarcely any stops (the middle point
being chiefly reserved to follow abridgements or numerals), the
stichometry being of itself an elaborate scheme of punctuation;
but the longer στίχοι of Cod. Bezae are often divided by a single
point.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
18. In using manuscripts of the Greek Testament, we must
carefully note whether a reading is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span> (*) or by some
subsequent corrector (**). It will often happen that these last
are utterly valueless, having been inserted even from printed
copies by a modern owner (like some marginal variations of the
Cod. Leicestrensis)<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>, and such as these really ought not to have
been extracted by collators at all; while others by the second
hand are almost as weighty, for age and goodness, as the text
itself. All these points are explained by critical editors for each
document separately; in fact to discriminate the different corrections
in regard to their antiquity and importance is often the
most difficult portion of such editor's task (e.g. in Codd. Bezae
and Claromontanus), and one on which he often feels it hard to
satisfy his own judgement. Corrections by the original scribe, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by a contemporary reviser, where they can be satisfactorily
distinguished, must be regarded as a portion of the testimony of
the manuscript itself, inasmuch as every carefully prepared copy
was reviewed and compared (ἀντεβλήθη), if not by the writer
himself, by a skilful person appointed for the task (ὁ διορθῶν,
ὁ διορθωτής), whose duty it was to amend manifest errors, sometimes
also to insert ornamental capitals in places which had been
reserved for them; in later times (and as some believe at a very
early period) to set in stops, breathings and accents; in copies
destined for ecclesiastical use to arrange the musical notes that
were to guide the intonation of the reader. Notices of this kind
of revision are sometimes met with at the end of the best
manuscripts. Such is the note in Cod. H of St. Paul: εγραψα
και εξεθεμην προσ το εν Καισαρια αντιγραφον τησ διδλιοθηκησ του
αγιου Παμφιλου, the same library of the Martyr Pamphilus to
which the scribe of the Cod. Frid.-August. resorted for his model<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>;
and that in Birch's most valuable Urbino-Vatican. 2 (157 of the
Gospels), written for the Emperor John II (1118-1143), wherein
at the end of the first Gospel we read κατὰ Ματθαῖον ἐγράφη καὶ
ἀντεβλήθη ἐκ τῶν ἐν ἱεροσολύμοις παλαιῶν ἀντιγράφων τῶν ἐν ἁγίω
ὄρει [Athos] ἀποκειμένων: similar subscriptions are appended to
the other Gospels. See also Evan. Λ. 20, 164, 262, 300, 376;
Act. 15, 83, in the list of manuscripts below.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have next to give some account of ancient divisions of the
text, as found in manuscripts of the New Testament; and
these must be carefully noted by the student, since few copies are
without one or more of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. So far as we know at present, the oldest sections still
extant are those of the Codex Vaticanus. These seem to have
been formed for the purpose of reference, and a new one always
commences where there is some break in the sense. Many,
however, at least in the Gospels, consist of but one of our modern
verses, and they are so unequal in length as to be rather inconvenient
for actual use. In the four Gospels only the marginal
numerals are in red, St. Matthew containing 170 of these divisions,
St. Mark 62, St. Luke 152, St. John 80. In the Acts of the
Apostles are two sets of sections, thirty-six longer and in an older
hand, sixty-nine smaller and more recent<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>. Each of these also
begins after a break in the sense, but they are quite independent
of each other, as a larger section will sometimes commence in
the middle of a smaller, the latter being in no wise a subdivision
of the former. Thus the greater Γ opens Acts ii. 1, in the middle
of the lesser β, which extends from Acts i. 15 to ii. 4. The first
forty-two of the lesser chapters, down to Acts xv. 40, are found
also with slight variations in the margin of Codex Sinaiticus,
written by a very old hand. As in most manuscripts, so in Codex
Vaticanus, the Catholic Epistles follow the Acts, and in them
also and in St. Paul's Epistles there are two sets of sections, only
that in the Epistles the older sections are the more numerous.
The Pauline Epistles are reckoned throughout as one book in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
elder notation, with however this remarkable peculiarity, that
though in the Cod. Vatican. itself the Epistle to the Hebrews
stands next after the second to the Thessalonians, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and on the
same leaf with it</span></em>, the sections are arranged as if it stood between
the Epistles to the Galatians and Ephesians. For whereas that
to the Galatians ends with § 58, that to the Ephesians begins
with § 70, and the numbers proceed regularly down to § 93,
with which the second to the Thessalonians ends. The Epistle
to the Hebrews which then follows opens with § 59; the last
section extant (§ 64) begins at Heb. ix. 11, and the manuscript
ends abruptly at καθα ver. 14. It plainly appears, then, that the
sections of the Codex Vaticanus must have been copied from
some yet older document, in which the Epistle to the Hebrews
preceded that to the Ephesians. It will be found hereafter
(vol. ii) that in the Thebaic version the Epistle to the
Hebrews preceded that to the Galatians, instead of following it,
as here. For a list of the more modern divisions in the Epistles,
see the Table given below. The Vatican sections of the Gospels
have also been discovered by Tregelles in one other copy, the
palimpsest Codex Zacynthius of St. Luke (Ξ), which he published
in 1861.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Hardly less ancient, and indeed ascribed by some to
Tatian the Harmonist, the disciple of Justin Martyr, is the
division of the Gospels into larger chapters or κεφάλαια <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">majora</span></span><a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>.
It may be noticed that in none of the four Gospels does the first
chapter stand at its commencement. In St. Matthew chapter A
begins at chap. ii. verse 1, and has for its title περὶ τῶν μάγων: in
St. Mark at chap. i. ver. 23 περὶ τοῧ δαιμονιζομένου: in St. Luke
at chap. ii. ver. 1 περὶ τῆς ἀπογραφῆς: in St. John at chap. ii. ver. 1
περὶ τοῦ ἐν Κανᾶ γάμου. Mill accounts for this circumstance by
supposing that in the first copies the titles at the head of each
Gospel were reserved till last for more splendid illumination,
and were thus eventually forgotten (Proleg. N. T. § 355); Griesbach
holds, that the general inscriptions of each Gospel, Κατὰ
Ματθαῖον, Κατὰ Μάρκον, &amp;c., were regarded as the special titles of
the first chapters also. On either supposition, however, it would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be hard to explain how what was really the second chapter came
to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">numbered</span></em> as the first; and it is worth notice that the
same arrangement takes place in the κεφάλαια (though these are
of a later date) of all the other books of the New Testament
except the Acts, 2 Corinth., Ephes., 1 Thess., Hebrews, James,
1 and 2 Peter, 1 John, and the Apocalypse: e.g. the first chapter
of the Epistle to the Romans opens ch. i. ver. 18 Πρῶτον μετὰ τὸ
προοίμιον, περὶ κρίσεως τῆς κατὰ ἐθνῶν τῶν οὐ φυλασσόντων τὰ φυσικά.
But the fact is that this arrangement, strange as it may seem, is
conformable to the practice of the times when these divisions
were finally settled. Both in the Institutes and in the Digest of
Justinian the first paragraph is always cited as pr. (i.e. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">principium</span></span>,
προοίμιον, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span>), and what we should regard as the
second paragraph is numbered as the first, and so on throughout
the whole work<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The τίτλοι in St. Matthew amount to sixty-eight, in St. Mark
to forty-eight, in St. Luke to eighty-three, in St. John to
eighteen. This mode of division, although not met with in
the Vatican and Sinaitic manuscripts, is found in the Codices
Alexandrinus and Ephraemi of the fifth century, and in the
Codex Nitriensis of the sixth, each of which has tables of
the τίτλοι prefixed to the several Gospels: but the Codices
Alexandrinus, Rossanensis, and Dublinensis of St. Matthew, and
that portion of the purple Cotton fragment which is in the
Vatican, exhibit them in their usual position, at the top and
bottom of the pages. Thus it appears that they were too
generally diffused in the fifth century not to have originated at
an earlier period; although we must concede that the κεφάλαιον
spoken of by Clement of Alexandria (Stromat. i) when quoting
Dan. xii. 12, or by Athanasius (contra Arium) on Act. ii, and
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Capitulum</span></span> mentioned by Tertullian (ad Uxorem ii. 2) in
reference to 1 Cor. vii. 12, contain no certain allusions to any
specific divisions of the sacred text, but only to the particular
paragraphs or passages in which their citations stand. Except
that the contrary habit has grown inveterate<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>, it were much to be
desired that the term τίτλοι should be applied to these longer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
divisions, at least in the Gospels; but since usage has affixed the
term κεφάλαια to the larger chapters and sections to the smaller,
and τίτλοι only to the subjects or headings of the former, it would
be useless to follow any other system of names.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The Ammonian Sections were not constructed, like
the Vatican divisions and the τίτλοι, for the purpose of easy
reference, or distributed like them according to the breaks in the
sense, but for a wholly different purpose. So far as we can
ascertain, the design of Tatian's Harmony was simply to present
to Christian readers a single connected history of our Lord, by
taking from the four Evangelists indifferently whatsoever best
suited his purpose<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>. As this plan could scarcely be executed
without <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitting</span></em> some portions of the sacred text, it is not
surprising that Tatian, possibly without any evil intention,
should have incurred the grave charge of mutilating Holy
Scripture<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>. A more scholar-like and useful attempt was subsequently
made by Ammonius of Alexandria, early in the third
century [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 220], who, by the side of St. Matthew's Gospel,
which he selected as his standard, arranged in parallel columns,
as it would seem, the corresponding passages of the other three
Evangelists, so as to exhibit them all at once to the reader's eye;
St. Matthew in his proper order, the rest as the necessity of
abiding by St. Matthew's order prescribed. This is the account
given by the celebrated Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, the Church
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
historian, who in the fourth century, in his letter to Carpianus,
described his own most ingenious system of Harmony, as founded
on, or at least as suggested by, the labours of Ammonius<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a>. It
has been generally thought that the κεφάλαια, of which St. Matthew
contains 355, St. Mark 236<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a>, St. Luke 342, St. John 232,
in all 1165, were made by Ammonius for the purpose of his
work, and they have commonly received the name of the Ammonian
sections: but this opinion was called in question by
Bp. Lloyd (Nov. Test. Oxon. 1827, Monitum, pp. viii-xi), who
strongly urges that, in his Epistle to Carpianus, Eusebius not
only refrains from ascribing these numerical divisions to Ammonius
(whose labours in this particular, as once seemed the
case with Tatian's, must in that case be deemed to have perished
utterly), but he almost implies that they had their origin at the
same time with his own ten canons, with which they are so
intimately connected<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>. That they were essential to Eusebius'
scheme is plain enough; their place in Ammonius' parallel
Harmony is not easily understood, unless indeed (what is
nowhere stated, but rather the contrary) he did not set the
passages from the other Gospels at full length by the side of
St. Matthew's, but only these numerical references to them<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, however, one ground for hesitation before we ascribe
the sections, as well as the canons, to Eusebius; namely, that
not a few ancient manuscripts (e.g. Codd. FHY) contain the
former, while they omit the latter. Of palimpsests indeed it
might be said with reason, that the rough process which so
nearly obliterated the ink of the older writing, would completely
remove the coloured paint (κιννάβαρις, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vermilion</span></span>, prescribed by
Eusebius, though blue or green is occasionally found) in which
the canons were invariably noted; hence we need not wonder
at their absence from the Codices Ephraemi, Nitriensis (R),
Dublinensis (Z), Codd. IW<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span> of Tischendorf, and the Wolfenbüttel
fragments (PQ), in all which the sections are yet legible in ink.
The Codex Sinaiticus contains both; but Tischendorf decidedly
pronounces them to be in a later hand. In the Codex Bezae
too, as well as the Codex Cyprius (K), even the Ammonian
sections, without the canons, are by later hands, though the
latter has prefixed the list or table of the canons. Of the oldest
copies the Cod. Alex. (A), Tischendorf's Codd. W<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span>Θ, the Cotton
frag. (N), and Codd. Beratinus and Rossanensis alone contain
both the sections and the canons. Even in more modern cursive
books the latter are often deficient, though the former are
present. This peculiarity we have observed in Burney 23, in
the British Museum, of the twelfth century, although the Epistle
to Carpianus stands at the beginning; in a rather remarkable
copy of about the twelfth century, in the Cambridge University
Library (Mm. 6. 9, Scholz Evan. 440), in which, however, the
table of canons but not the Epistle to Carpianus precedes; in
the Gonville and Caius Gospels of the twelfth century (Evan. 59),
and in a manuscript of about the thirteenth century at Trinity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
College, Cambridge (B. x. 17)<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>. These facts certainly seem to
indicate that in the judgement of critics and transcribers, whatever
that judgement may be deemed worth, the Ammonian
sections had a previous existence to the Eusebian canons, as
well as served for an independent purpose<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his letter to Carpianus, their inventor clearly yet briefly
describes the purpose of his canons, ten in number. The first
contains a list of seventy-one places in which all the four
Evangelists have a narrative, discourse, or saying in common:
the second of 111 places in which the three Matthew, Mark,
Luke agree: the third of twenty-two places common to Matthew,
Luke, John: the fourth of twenty-six passages common to
Matthew, Mark, John: the fifth of eighty-two places in which
the two Matthew, Luke coincide: the sixth of forty-seven places
wherein Matthew, Mark agree: the seventh of seven places
common to Matthew and John: the eighth of fourteen places
common to Luke and Mark: the ninth of twenty-one places in
which Luke and John agree: the tenth of sixty-two passages of
Matthew, twenty-one of Mark, seventy-one of Luke, and ninety-seven
of John which have no parallels, but are peculiar to a
single Evangelist. Under each of the 1165 so-named Ammonian
sections, in its proper place in the margin of a manuscript, is
put in coloured ink the number of that Eusebian canon to
which it refers. On looking for that section in the proper table
or canon, there will also be found the parallel place or places in
the other Gospels, each indicated by its proper numeral, and so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
readily searched out. A single example will serve to explain
our meaning. In the facsimile of the Cotton fragment (Plate <a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref">v</a>.
No. 14), in the margin of the passage (John xv. 20) we see
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΡΛΘ</span></span> over Γ, where ΡΑΘ (139) is the proper section of St. John, Γ (3)
the number of the canon. On searching the third Eusebian
table we read MT. [symbol], Λ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">νη</span></span>, ΙΩ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ρλθ</span></span> and thus we learn that the
first clause of John xv. 20 is parallel in sense to the ninetieth
([symbol]) section of St. Matthew (x. 24), and to the fifty-eighth (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">νη</span></span>) of
St. Luke (vi. 40). The advantage of such a system of parallels
to the exact study of the Gospels is too evident to need
insisting on.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles are also divided
into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chapters</span></em> (κεφάλαια), in design precisely the same as the
κεφάλαια or τίτλοι of the Gospels, and nearly like them in length.
Since there is no trace of these chapters in the two great
Codices Alexandrinus and Ephraemi, of the fifth century (which
yet exhibit the τίτλοι, the sections, and one of them the canons),
it seems reasonable to assume that they are of later date. They
are sometimes connected with the name of Euthalius, deacon of
Alexandria, afterwards Bishop of Sulci<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>, whom we have already
spoken of as the reputed author of Scriptural stichometry
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg053" class="tei tei-ref">53</a>). We learn, however, from Euthalius' own
Prologue to his edition of St. Paul's Epistles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 458,) that the
<span class="tei tei-q">“summary of the chapters”</span> (and consequently the numbers of the
chapters themselves) was taken from the work of <span class="tei tei-q">“one of our
wisest and pious fathers<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>,”</span> i.e. some Bishop that he does not
wish to particularize, whom Mill (Proleg. N. T. § 907) conjectures
to be Theodore of Mopsuestia, who lay under the censure of the
Church. Soon after<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> the publication of St. Paul's Epistles, on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the suggestion of one Athanasius, then a priest and afterwards
Patriarch of Alexandria, Euthalius put forth a similar edition of
the Acts and Catholic Epistles<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>, also divided into chapters, with
a summary of contents at the head of each chapter. Even these
he is thought to have derived (at least in the Acts) from the
manuscript of Pamphilus the Martyr [d. 308], to whom the
same order of chapters is ascribed in a document published by
Montfaucon (Bibliotheca Coislin. p. 78); the rather as Euthalius
fairly professes to have compared his book in the Acts and
Catholic Epistles <span class="tei tei-q">“with the copies in the library at Caesarea”</span>
which once belonged to <span class="tei tei-q">“Eusebius the friend of Pamphilus<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>.”</span>
The Apocalypse still remains. It was divided, about the end of
the fifth century, by Andreas, Archbishop of the Cappadocian
Caesarea, into twenty-four <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paragraphs</span></em> (λόγοι), corresponding to
the number of the elders about the throne (Apoc. iv. 4); each
paragraph being subdivided into three <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chapters</span></em> (κεφάλαια)<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a>. The
summaries which Andreas wrote of his seventy-two chapters
are still reprinted in Mill's and other large editions of the Greek
Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. To Euthalius has been also referred a division of the Acts
into sixteen lessons (ἀναγνώσεις) and of the Pauline Epistles
into thirty-one (see table on p. <a href="#Pg067" class="tei tei-ref">67</a>); but these lessons are
quite different from the much shorter ones adopted by the
Greek Church. He is also said to have numbered in each Epistle
of St. Paul the quotations from the Old Testament<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>, which are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still noted in many of our manuscripts, and is the first known to
have used that reckoning of the στίχοι which was formerly
annexed we know not when to the Gospels and Epistles, as well
as to the Acts. Besides the division of the text into στίχοι or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lines</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg052" class="tei tei-ref">52</a>) we find in the Gospels alone another division
into ῥήματα or ῥήσεις <span class="tei tei-q">“sentences,”</span> differing but little from the
στίχοι in number. Of these last the precise numbers vary in
different copies, though not considerably: whether that variation
arose from the circumstance that ancient numbers were represented
by letters and so easily became corrupted, or from
a different mode of arranging the στίχοι and ῥήματα adopted by
the various scribes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. It is proper to state that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subscriptions</span></em> (ὑπογραφαί)
appended to St. Paul's Epistles in many manuscripts, and retained
even in the Authorized English version of the New Testament,
are also said to be the composition of Euthalius. In the best
copies they are somewhat shorter in form, but in any shape they
do no credit to the care or skill of their author, whoever he may
be. <span class="tei tei-q">“Six of these subscriptions,”</span> writes Paley in that masterpiece
of acute reasoning, the Horae Paulinae, <span class="tei tei-q">“are false or improbable;”</span>
that is, they are either absolutely contradicted by the contents of
the epistle [1 Cor., Galat., 1 Tim.], or are difficult to be reconciled
with them [1, 2 Thess., Tit.].
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subscriptions</span></em> to the Gospels have not, we believe, been
assigned to any particular author, and being seldom found in
printed copies of the Greek Testament or in modern versions,
are little known to the general reader. In the earliest manuscripts
the subscriptions, as well as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">titles</span></em> of the books, were of the
simplest character. Κατὰ Μαθθαῖον, κατὰ Μάρκον, &amp;c. is all that
the Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have, whether at the beginning
or the end. Εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ματθαῖον is the subscription to
the first Gospel in the Codex Alexandrinus; εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ
Μάρκον is placed at the beginning of the second Gospel in the
same manuscript, and the self-same words at the end of it by
Codices Alex. and Ephraemi: in the Codex Bezae (in which
St. John stands second in order) we merely read εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ
Μαθθαῖον ἐτελέσθη, ἄρχεται εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ἰωάννην. The same is
the case throughout the New Testament. After a while the titles
become more elaborate, and the subscriptions afford more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
information, the truth of which it would hardly be safe to vouch
for. The earliest worth notice are found in the Codex Cyprius
(K) of the eighth or ninth century, which, together with those of
several other copies, are given in Scholz's Prolegomena N. T.
vol. i. pp. xxix, xxx. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad fin. Matthaei</span></span>: Τὸ κατὰ Ματθαῖον
εὐαγγέλιον ἐξεδόθη ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἱεροσολύμοις μετὰ χρόνους ἡ [ὀκτὼ]
τῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἀναλήψεως. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad fin. Marci</span></span>: Τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον
εὐαγγέλιον ἐξεδόθη μετὰ χρόνους δέκα τῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἀναλήψεως.
Those to the other two Gospels exactly resemble St. Mark's, that
of St. Luke however being dated fifteen, that of St. John thirty-two
years after our Lord's Ascension, periods in all probability
far too early to be correct.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The foreign matter so often inserted in later manuscripts
has more value for the antiquarian than for the critic. That
splendid copy of the Gospels Lambeth 1178, of the tenth or
eleventh century, contains more such than is often found, set off
by fine illuminations. At the end of each of the first three
Gospels (but not of the fourth) are several pages relating to them
extracted from Cosmas Indicopleustes, who made the voyage
which procured him his cognomen about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 522; also some
iambic verses of no great excellence, as may well be supposed. In
golden letters we read: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad fin. Matth.</span></span> ἰστέον ὅτι τὸ κατὰ Ματθαῖον
εὐαγγέλιον ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτωι γραφὲν ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ; ἐν ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξεδόθη;

alludes to Apoc. iv. 7, wherein the four living creatures were
currently believed to be typical of the four Gospels<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad fin.

8. The oldest manuscript known to be accompanied by
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">catena</span></em> (or continuous commentary by different authors) is the
palimpsest Codex Zacynthius (Ξ of Tregelles), an uncial of the
eighth century. Such books are not common, but there is a very
full commentary in minute letters, surrounding the large text
in a noble copy of the Gospels, of the twelfth century, which
belonged to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps (Middle Hill 13975,
since removed to Cheltenham), yet uncollated; another of St.
Paul's Epistles (No. 27) belongs to the University Library at
Cambridge (Ff. 1. 30). The Apocalypse is often attended with
the exposition of Andreas (p. 64), or of Arethas, also Archbishop
of the Cappadocian Caesarea in the tenth century, or (what is
more usual) with a sort of epitome of the two (e.g. Parham
No. 17), above, below, and in the margin beside the text, in
much smaller characters. In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cursive</span></em> manuscripts only the subject
(ὑπόθεσις), especially that written by Oecumenius in the tenth
century, sometimes stands as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Prologue</span></em> before each book, but
not so often before the Gospels or Apocalypse as the Acts and
Epistles. Before the Acts we occasionally meet with Euthalius'
Chronology of St. Paul's Travels, or another Ἀποδημία Παύλου.
The Leicester manuscript contains between the Pauline Epistles
and the Acts (1) An Exposition of the Creed and statement of
the errors condemned by the seven general Councils, ending with
the second at Nice. (2) Lives of the Apostles, followed by an
exact description of the limits of the five Patriarchates. The
Christ Church copy Wake 12 also has after the Apocalypse some
seven or eight pages of a Treatise Περὶ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ οἰκουμενικῶν
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ζ</span></span> συνόδων, including some notice περὶ τοπικῶν συνόδων. Similar
treatises may be more frequent in manuscripts of the Greek
Testament than we are at present aware of.

10. On the divisions into chapters and verses prevailing in
our modern Bibles we need not dwell long. For many centuries
the Latin Church used the Greek τίτλοι (which they called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">breves</span></span>) with the Euthalian κεφάλαια, and some of their copies
even retained the calculation by στίχοι: but about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1248
Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro, while preparing a Concordance,
or index of declinable words, for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole Bible</span></em>, divided it into
its present chapters, subdividing them in turn into several parts
by placing the letters A, B, C, D &amp;c. in the margin, at equal
distances from each other, as we still see in many old printed
books, e.g. Stephen's N. T. of 1550. Cardinal Hugo's divisions,
unless indeed he merely adopted them from Lanfranc or some
other scholar, such as was very probably Stephen Langton the
celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury, soon took possession of
copies of the Latin Vulgate; they gradually obtained a place
in later Greek manuscripts, especially those written in the West
of Europe, and are found in the earliest printed and all later
editions of the Greek Testament, though still unknown to the
Eastern Church. They certainly possess no strong claim on our
preference, although they cannot now be superseded. The
chapters are inconveniently and capriciously unequal in length;
occasionally too they are distributed with much lack of judgement.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Thus Matt. xv. 39 belongs to ch. xvi, and perhaps
ch. xix. 30 to ch. xx; Mark ix. 1 properly appertains to the
preceding chapter; Luke xxi. 1-4 had better be united with
ch. xx, as in Mark xii. 41-44; Acts v might as well commence
with Acts iv. 32; Acts viii. 1 (or at least its first clause) should
not have been separated from ch. vii; Acts xxi concludes with
strange abruptness. Bp. Terrot (on Ernesti's Institutes, vol. ii.
p. 21) rightly affixes 1 Cor. iv. 1-5 to ch. iii. Add that 1 Cor.
xi. 1 belongs to ch. x; 2 Cor. iv. 18 and vi. 18 to ch. v and
ch. vii respectively: Col. iv. 1 must clearly go with ch. iii.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In commendation of the modern verses still less can be said.
As they are stated to have been constructed after the model of
the ancient στίχοι (called <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">versus</span></span>”</span> in the Latin manuscripts),
we have placed in the Table the exact number of each for every
book in the New Testament. Of the στίχοι we reckon 19241 in
all, of the modern verses 7959<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>, so that on the average (for we
have seen that the manuscript variations in the number of στίχοι
are but inconsiderable) we may calculate about five στίχοι to
every two modern verses. The fact is that some such division is,
simply indispensable to every accurate reader of Scripture; and
Cardinal Hugo's divisions by letters of the alphabet, as well as
those adopted by Sanctes Pagninus in his Latin version of the
whole Bible (1528), having proved inconveniently large, Robert
Stephen, the justly celebrated printer and editor of the Greek
Testament, undertook to form a system of verse-divisions, taking
for his model the short verses into which the Hebrew Bible had
already been divided, as it would seem by Rabbi Nathan, in the
preceding century. We are told by Henry Stephen (Praef.
Concordantiae) that his father Robert executed this design on
a journey from Paris to Lyons <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inter equitandum</span></span><a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>;”</span> that is, we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
presume, while resting at the inns on the road. Certain it is
that, although every such division must be in some measure
arbitrary, a very little care would have spared us many of the
disadvantages attending that which Robert Stephen first published
at Geneva in his Greek Testament of 1551, from which
it was introduced into the text of the Genevan English Testament
of 1557, into Beza's Greek Testament of 1565, and thence
into subsequent editions. It is now too late to correct the
errors of the verse-divisions, but they can be neutralized, at
least in a great degree, by the plan adopted by modern critics,
of banishing both the verses and the chapters into the margin,
and breaking the text into paragraphs, better suited to the
sense. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pericopae</span></span> or sections of Bengel<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> (whose labours
will be described in their proper place) have been received with
general approbation, and adopted, with some modification, by
several recent editors. Much pains were bestowed on their
arrangement of the paragraphs by the Revisers of the English
version of 1881.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. We now come to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contents</span></em> of manuscripts of the Greek
Testament, and must distinguish regular copies of the sacred
volume or of parts of it from Lectionaries, or Church-lesson
books, containing only extracts, arranged in the order of Divine
Service daily throughout the year. The latter we will consider
presently: with regard to the former it is right to bear in mind,
that comparatively few copies of the whole New Testament
remain; the usual practice being to write the four Gospels in
one volume, the Acts and Epistles in another: manuscripts of
the Apocalypse, which was little used for public worship, being
much rarer than those of the other books. Occasionally the
Gospels, Acts, and Epistles form a single volume; sometimes
the Apocalypse is added to other books; as to the Pauline
Epistles in Lambeth 1186, or even to the Gospels, in a later hand
(e.g. Cambridge University Libr. Dd. 9. 69: Gospels No. 60,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dated</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1297). The Apocalypse, being a short work, is often
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
found bound up in volumes containing very miscellaneous matter
(e.g. Vatican. 2066 or B; Brit. Mus. Harleian. 5678, No. 31; and
Oxon. Barocc. 48, No. 28). The Codex Sinaiticus of Tischendorf
is the more precious, in that it happily exhibits the whole New
Testament complete: so would also the Codices Alexandrinus and
Ephraemi, but that they are sadly mutilated: no other uncial
copies have this advantage, and very few cursives. In England
only five such are known, the great Codex Leicestrensis, which
is imperfect at the beginning and end; Butler 2 (Evan. 201)
Additional 11837, dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1357, and (Evan. 584) Additional
17469, both in the British Museum; Canonici 34 (Evan. 488) in
the Bodleian, dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1515-16. Additional MS. 28815 (Evan.
603, and Paul 266, and Apoc. 89) in the British Museum and
B-C. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ii.</span></span> 4 at Sir Roger Cholmely's School, Highgate, are
separated portions of one complete copy. The Apocalypse in
the well-known Codex Montfortianus at Dublin is usually considered
to be by a later hand. Besides these Scholz enumerates
only nineteen foreign copies of the whole New Testament<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>;
making but twenty-four in all, as far as was then known, out
of the vast mass of extant documents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. Whether copies contain the whole or a part of the
sacred volume, the general <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">order</span></em> of the books is the following:
Gospels, Acts, Catholic Epistles, Pauline Epistles, Apocalypse.
A solitary manuscript of the fifteenth century (Venet. 10, Evan.
209) places the Gospels between the Pauline Epistles and the
Apocalypse<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>; in the Codices Sinaiticus, Leicestrensis, Fabri
(Evan. 90), and Montfortianus, as in the Bodleian Canonici 34,
the copy in the King's Library Brit. Mus. (Act. 20), and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Complutensian edition (1514), the Pauline Epistles precede the
Acts. The Pauline Epistles stand between the Acts and the
Catholic Epistles in Phillipps 1284, Evan. 527; Parham 71. 6,
Evan. 534; Upsal, Sparfwenfeldt 42, Acts 68; Paris Reg. 102 A,
Acts 119; Reg. 103 A, Acts 120. In Oxford Bodl. Miscell. 74
the order is Acts, Cath. Epp., Apocalypse, Paul. Epp., but an
earlier hand wrote from 3 John onwards. In Evan. 51 Dr. C. R.
Gregory points out minute indications that the scribe, not the
binder, set the Gospels last. In the Memphitic and Thebaic the
Acts follow the Catholic Epistles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> below, vol. ii, chap. iii). The
Codex Basiliensis (No. 4 of the Epistles), Acts Cod. 134, Brit.
Mus. Addl. 19388, Lambeth 1182, 1183, and Burdett-Coutts III. 1,
have the Pauline Epistles immediately after the Acts and before
the Catholic Epistles, as in our present Bibles. Scholz's Evan.
368 stands thus, St. John's Gospel, Apocalypse, then all the
Epistles; in Havniens. 1 (Cod. 234 of the Gospels, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1278)
the order appears to be Acts, Paul. Ep., Cath. Ep., Gospels; in
Ambros. Z 34 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sup.</span></span> at Milan, Dean Burgon testifies that the
Catholic and Pauline Epistles are followed by the Gospels; in
Basil. B. vi. 27 or Cod. 1, the Gospels have been bound after the
Acts and Epistles; while in Evan. 175 the Apocalypse stands
between the Acts and Catholic Epistles; in Evan. 51 the binder
has set the Gospels last: these, however, are mere accidental
exceptions to the prevailing rule<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>. The four Gospels are almost
invariably found in their familiar order, although in the Codex
Bezae (as we partly saw above, p. <a href="#Pg065" class="tei tei-ref">65</a>) they stand Matthew,
John, Luke, Mark<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>; in the Codex Monacensis (X) John, Luke,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mark, Matthew (but two leaves of Matthew <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> stand before
John), also in the Latin <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>; in Cod. 90 (Fabri) John, Luke,
Matthew, Mark; in Cod. 399 at Turin John, Luke, Matthew,
an arrangement which Dr. Hort refers to the Commentary of
Titus of Bostra on St. Luke which accompanies it; in the
Curetonian Syriac version Matthew, Mark, John, Luke. In
the Pauline Epistles that to the Hebrews immediately follows
the second to the Thessalonians in the four great Codices
Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, and Ephraemi<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a>: in the
copy from which the Cod. Vatican. was taken the Hebrews
followed the Galatians (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg057" class="tei tei-ref">57</a>). The Codex Claromontanus,
the document next in importance to these four, sets
the Colossians appropriately enough next to its kindred and
contemporaneous Epistle to the Ephesians, but postpones that
to the Hebrews to Philemon, as in our present Bibles: an
arrangement which at first, no doubt, originated in the early
scruples prevailing in the Western Church, with respect to the
authorship and canonical authority of that divine epistle.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
13. We must now describe the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lectionaries</span></em> or Service-books
of the Greek Church, in which the portions of Scripture publicly
read throughout the year are set down in chronological order,
without regard to their actual places in the sacred volume. In
length and general arrangement they resemble not so much the
Lessons as the Epistles and Gospels in our English Book of
Common Prayer, only that every day in the year has its own
proper portion, and the numerous Saints' days independent
services of their own. These Lectionaries consist either of
lessons from the Gospels, and are then called <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelistaria</span></span> or
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangeliaria</span></span> (εὐαγγελιστάρια)<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>; or from the Acts and Epistles;
termed <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Praxapostolos</span></span> (πραξαπόστολος) or <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolos</span></span><a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>: the general
name of Lectionary is often, though incorrectly, confined to the
latter class. A few books called ἀποστολοευαγγέλια have lessons
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
taken both from the Gospels and the Apostolic writings. In
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Euchologies</span></span>, or Books of Offices, wherein both the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolos</span></span> and
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospels</span></em> are found, the former always precede in each Office,
just as the Epistle precedes the Gospel in the Service-books of
Western Christendom. The peculiar arrangement of Lectionaries
renders them very unfit for the hasty, partial, cursory collation
which has befallen too many manuscripts of the other class, and
this circumstance, joined with the irksomeness of using Service-books
never familiar to the habits even of scholars in this part
of Europe, has caused these documents to be so little consulted,
that the contents of the very best and oldest among them have
until recently been little known. Matthaei, of whose elaborate
and important edition of the Greek Testament (12 tom. Riga
1782-88) we shall give an account hereafter, has done excellent
service in this department; two of his best copies, the uncials
B and H (Nos. 47, 50), being Evangelistaria. The present
writer also has collated three noble uncials of the same rank,
Arundel 547 being of the ninth century, Parham 18 bearing date
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 980, Harleian 5598, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 995. Not a few other uncial
Lectionaries remain quite neglected, for though none of them
perhaps are older than the eighth century, the ancient character
was retained for these costly and splendid Service-books till
about the eleventh century (Montfaucon, Palaeogr. Graec. p. 260),
before which time the cursive hand was generally used in other
Biblical manuscripts. There is, of course, no place in a Lectionary
for divisions by κεφάλαια, for the so-called Ammonian sections,
or for the canons of Eusebius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The division of the New Testament into Church-lessons was,
however, of far more remote antiquity than the employment of
separate volumes to contain them. Towards the end of the
fourth century, that golden age of Patristic theology, Chrysostom
recognizes some stated order of the lessons as familiar to all his
hearers, for he exhorts them to peruse and mark beforehand the
passages (περικοπαί<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a>) of the Gospels which were to be publicly
read to them the ensuing Sunday or Saturday<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>. All the information
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we can gather favours the notion that there was no great
difference between the calendar of Church-lessons in earlier and
later stages. Not only do they correspond in all cases where
such agreement is natural, as in the proper services for the
great feasts and fasts, but in such purely arbitrary arrangements
as the reading of the book of Genesis, instead of the Gospels,
on the week days of Lent; of the Acts all the time between
Easter and Pentecost<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>; and the selection of St. Matthew's history
of the Passion alone at the Liturgy on Good Friday<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>. The
earliest formal <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Menologium</span></span>, or Table of proper lessons, now
extant is prefixed to the Codex Cyprius (K) of the eighth or
ninth century; another is found in the Codex Campianus (M),
which is perhaps a little later; they are more frequently found
than the contrary in later manuscripts of every kind; while
there are comparatively few copies that have not been accommodated
to ecclesiastical use either by their original scribe or
a later hand, by means of noting the proper days for each lesson
(often in red ink) at the top or bottom or in the margin of the
several pages. Not only in the margin, but even in the text
itself are perpetually interpolated, mostly in vermilion or red
ink, the beginning (ἀρχή or αρ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">χ</span></span>) and ending (τέλος or τε<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">λ</span></span>) of each
lesson, and the several words to be inserted or substituted in
order to suit the purpose of public reading; from which source
(as we have stated above, p. <a href="#Pg011" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>) various readings have almost
unavoidably sprung: e.g. in Acts iii. 11 τοῦ ἰαθέντος χωλοῦ of the
Lectionaries ultimately displaced αὐτοῦ from the text itself.

We purpose to annex to this Chapter a table of lessons
throughout the year, according to the use laid down in Synaxaria,
Menologies, and Lectionaries, as well to enable the student to
compare the proper lessons of the Greek Church with our own,
as to facilitate reference to the manuscripts themselves, which
are now placed almost out of the reach of the inexperienced.
On comparing the manner in which the terms are used by
different scribes and authors, we conceive that <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Synaxarion</span></span>
(συναξάριον) is, like Eclogadion, a name used for a table of daily
lessons for the year beginning at Easter, and that these have
varied but slightly in the course of many ages throughout the
whole Eastern Church; that tables of Saints' day lessons, called
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Menologies</span></span>, (μηνολόγιον), distributed in order of the months from
September (when the new year and the indiction began) to
August, differed widely from each other, both in respect to the
lessons read and the days kept holy<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>. While the great feasts
remained entirely the same, different generations and provinces
and even dioceses had their favourite worthies, whose memory
they specially cherished; so that the character of the menology
(which sometimes forms a larger, sometimes but a small portion
of a Lectionary) will often guide us to the country and district
in which the volume itself was written. The Parham Evangelistarium
18 affords us a conspicuous example of this fact:
coming from a region of which we know but little (Ciscissa in
Cappadocia Prima), its menology in many particulars but little
resembles those usually met with<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>.

14. It only remains to say a few words about the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">notation</span></em>
adopted to indicate the several classes of manuscripts of the
Greek Testament. These classes are six in number; that containing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Gospels (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelia</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evan.</span></span>), or the Acts and
Catholic Epistles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Act.</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cath.</span></span>), or the Pauline Epistles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paul.</span></span>),
or the Apocalypse (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apoc.</span></span>), or Lectionaries of the Gospels (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelistaria</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evst.</span></span>), or those of the Acts and Epistles (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolos</span></span> or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apost.</span></span>). When one manuscript (as often happens) belongs to
more than one of these classes, its distinct parts are numbered
separately, so that a copy of the whole New Testament will
appear in four lists, and be reckoned four times over. All
critics are agreed in distinguishing the documents written in the
uncial character by capital letters; the custom having originated
in the accidental circumstance that the Codex Alexandrinus
was designated as Cod. A in the lower margin of Walton's
Polyglott. Lectionaries in uncial letters are not marked by
capitals, but by Arabic numerals, like cursive manuscripts of all
classes<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>. Of course no system can escape some attendant evils.
Even the catalogue of the later manuscripts is often upon its
first appearance full of mis-statements, of repetitions and loose
descriptions, which must be remedied and supplied in subsequent
examination, so far as opportunity is granted from time to time.
In describing the uncials (as we purpose to do in the two
next chapters) our course is tolerably plain; but the lists that
comprise the last eight chapters of this volume, and which
respectively detail the cursive manuscripts and the Lectionaries
of the Greek Testament, must be regarded only as an approximation
to what such an enumeration ought to be, though much
pains and time have been spent upon them: the comparatively
few copies which seem to be sufficiently known are distinguished
by an asterisk from their less fortunate kindred.

For indeed the only method of grappling with the perplexity
produced by the large additions of manuscripts, especially of the
cursive character, which constant discovery has effected during
late years, is to enumerate arithmetically those which have been
supplied from time to time, as was done in the last edition of this
work, carefully noting if they have been examined by a competent
judge or especially if they have been properly collated.
In the Appendix of the third edition, the late Dean Burgon
continued his work in this direction by adding a list of some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
three hundred and seventy-four cursives, besides the others with
which he had previously increased the number before known.
That list, as was stated in the Postscript to the Preface, awaited
an examination and collation by competent persons. Such an
examination has been made in many instances by Dr. C. R.
Gregory, who also, whether fired by Dean Burgon's example as
shown in his published letters in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span> or not, has in
his turn added with most commendable diligence in research
a very large number of MSS. previously unknown. Some more
have been added in this edition, but much work is still required
of scholars, before this mass of materials can be used with effect
by Textual students.

We have now traced the daily service of the Greek Church, as derived from
the Gospels, throughout the whole year, from Easter Day to Easter Even, only
that in Lent the lessons from the 2nd to the 6th days inclusive in each week
are taken from the book of Genesis. The reader will observe that from Easter
to Pentecost St. John and the Acts are read for seven weeks, or eight Sundays.
The first Sunday after Pentecost is the Greek All Saints' Day, their Trinity Sunday
being virtually kept a fortnight earlier; but from the Monday next after the day of
Pentecost (Whit-Monday) St. Matthew is used continuously every day for eleven
weeks and as many Sundays. For six weeks more, St. Matthew is appointed for
the Saturday and Sunday lessons, St. Mark for the other days of the week. But
inasmuch as St. Luke was to be taken up with the new year, the year of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indiction [Arund. 547], which in this case must be September 24<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>, if all the lessons
in Matthew and Mark were not read out by this time (which, unless Easter was
very early, would not be the case), they were at once broken off, and (after proper
lessons had been employed for the Sunday before and the Saturday and Sunday
which followed<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> the feast of the Elevation of the Cross, Sept. 14) the lessons from
St. Luke (seventeen weeks and sixteen Sundays in all) were taken up and read on
as far as was necessary: only that the 17th Sunday of St. Matthew (called from the
subject of its Gospel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Canaanitess</span></span>) was always resumed on the Sunday preceding
that before the Carnival (πρὸ τῆς ἀποκρέω), which is also named from its Gospel
that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Prodigal</span></span>, and answers to the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Septuagesima</span></span>. Then follow the Sunday
of the Carnival (ἀποκρέω) or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sexagesima</span></span>, that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cheese-eater</span></span> (τυροφάγου) or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quinquagesima</span></span>,
and the six Sundays in Lent. The whole number of Sunday Gospels in
the year (even reckoning the two interpolated about September 14) is thus only
fifty-three, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canaanitess</span></span> coming twice over: but in the Menology or Catalogue of
immoveable feasts will be found proper lessons for three Saturdays and Sundays
about Christmas and Epiphany, which could either be substituted for, or added
to the ordinary Gospels for the year, according as the distance from Easter in one
year to Easter in the next exceeded or fell short of fifty-two weeks. The system
of lessons from the Acts and Epistles is much simpler than that of the Gospels:
it exhibits fifty-two Sundays in the year, without any of the complicated arrangements
of the other scheme. Since the Epistles from the Saturday of the 16th
week after Pentecost to the Sunday of the Prodigal could not be set (like the rest)
by the side of their corresponding Gospels, they are given separately in the
following table<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We proceed to describe in detail the uncial manuscripts of
the Greek Testament, arranged separately as copies of the
Gospels, of the Acts and Catholic Epistles, of the Pauline
Epistles, and of the Apocalypse. They are usually indicated
by the capital letters of the English and Greek alphabets, and
stand on the list not in the order of their relative value or
antiquity, but mainly as they were applied from time to time
to the purposes of Textual criticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
א (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aleph</span></span>). <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Sinaiticus</span></span>, now at St. Petersburg, the
justly celebrated copy which sometime ago for a quarter of a century
attracted general attention in the learned world. Tischendorf
(Notitia Ed. Cod. Sinaitici, pp. 5, 6) when travelling in
1844 under the patronage of his own sovereign, King Frederick
Augustus of Saxony, picked out of a basket full of papers destined
to light the oven of the Convent of St. Catherine on Mount
Sinai, the forty-three leaves of the Septuagint which he published
in 1846 as the Codex Friderico-Augustanus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg032" class="tei tei-ref">32</a>). These,
of course, he easily got for the asking, but finding that further
portions of the same codex (e.g. the whole of Isaiah and 1, 4
Maccabees) were extant, he rescued them from their probable
fate, by enlightening the brotherhood as to their value. He was
permitted to copy one page of what yet remained, containing
the end of Isaiah and the beginning of Jeremiah, which he
afterwards published in the first volume of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta Sacra
Inedita”</span> (1855), pp. xxx. and 213-16; and he departed in the
full hope that he should be allowed to purchase the whole. But
he had taught the monks a sharp lesson, and neither then, nor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on his subsequent visit in 1853, could he gain any tidings of the
leaves he had left behind;—he even seems to have concluded
that they had been carried into Europe by some richer or more
fortunate collector. At the beginning of 1859, after the care of
the seventh edition of his N. T. was happily over, he went for a
third time into the East, under the well-deserved patronage of
the Emperor of Russia, the great protector of the Oriental
Church; and the treasure which had been twice withdrawn
from him as a private traveller, was now, on the occasion of
some chance conversation, spontaneously put into the hands of one
sent from the champion and benefactor of the oppressed Church.
Tischendorf touchingly describes his surprise, his joy, his midnight
studies over the priceless volume (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quippe dormire nefas
videbatur</span></span>”</span>) on that memorable 4th of February, 1859. The
rest was easy; he was allowed to copy his prize at Cairo, and
ultimately to bring it to Europe, as a tribute of duty and
gratitude to the Emperor Alexander II. To that monarch's wise
munificence both the larger edition (1862), and the smaller of the
New Testament only (1863), are mainly due.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Codex Sinaiticus is 13-½ inches in length by 14-7/8 inches
high, and consists of 346-½ leaves of the same beautiful vellum
as the Cod. Friderico-Augustanus which is really a part of it
whereof 199 contain portions of the Septuagint version, 147-½
the whole New Testament, Barnabas' Epistle, and a considerable
fragment of Hermas' Shepherd. It has subsequently
appeared that the Russian Archimandrite (afterwards Bishop)
Porphyry had brought with him from Sinai in 1845 some pieces of
Genesis xxiii, xxiv, and of Numbers v, vi, and vii, which had been
applied long before to the binding of other books<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>. Each page
comprises four columns (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg027" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>), with forty-eight lines in each
column, of those continuous, noble, simple uncials (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">compare</span></span> Plate
<a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">iv</a>. 11 a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></span> 11 b). The poetical books of the Old Testament,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however, being written in στίχοι, admit of only two columns
on a page (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg052" class="tei tei-ref">52</a>). <span class="tei tei-q">“In the Catholic Epistles the scribe
has frequently contented himself with a column of forty-seven
lines<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>.”</span> The order of the sacred books is remarkable, though
by no means unprecedented. St. Paul's Epistles precede the
Acts, and amongst them, that to the Hebrews follows 2 Thess.,
standing on the same page with it (p. 74). Although this manuscript
has hitherto been inspected by few Englishmen (Tregelles,
however, and Dean Stanley were among the number),
yet its general aspect has grown familiar to us by the means of
photographs of its most important pages taken for the use of
private scholars<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>, as well as from the facsimiles contained in
Tischendorf's several editions. Breathings and accents there
are none except in Tobit vi. 9, and Gal. v. 21, as has been
already mentioned: the apostrophus and the single point for
punctuation are entirely absent for pages together, yet
occasionally are rather thickly studded, not only in places
where a later hand has been unusually busy (e.g. Isaiah
i. 1-iii. 2, two pages), but in some others (e.g. in 2 Cor. xii. 20
there are eight stops). Even words very usually abridged
(except <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">θσ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">κσ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ισ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">χσ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">πνα</span></span> which are constant) are here written in
full though the practice varies, πατηρ, υιος, ουρανος, ανθρωπος,
δαυειδ: we find ϊσραηλ´, ισλ or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ιηλ</span></span>: ϊερουσαλημ´, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ιημ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ιλμ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ιηλμ´</span></span>.
Tischendorf considers the two points over iota and upsilon

especially at the end of lines, where the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">superscript</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg050" class="tei tei-ref">50</a>)

Mark i. 1-35). Other <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">compendia scribendi</span></span> are Κ for και, and ΗΝ

Although there are no capitals, the initial letter of a line which
begins a paragraph generally (not always) stands out from the
rank of the rest, as in the Old Testament portion of Cod. Vaticanus,
and less frequently in the New, after the fashion of
certain earlier pieces on papyrus. The titles and subscriptions
of the several books are as short as possible (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg065" class="tei tei-ref">65</a>).
The τίτλοι or κεφάλαια <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">majora</span></span> are absent; the margin contains
the so-called Ammonian sections and Eusebian canons,
but Tischendorf is positive that neither they nor such notes as

are by the original scribe, although they may possibly be due
to a contemporary hand. From the number of ὁμοιοτέλευτα
and other errors, one cannot affirm that it is very carefully
written. Its itacisms are of the oldest type, and those not constant;
chiefly ι for ει, and δε and ε, and much more rarely η
and υ and οι interchanged. The grammatical forms commonly
termed Alexandrian occur, pretty much as in other manuscripts
of the earliest date. The whole manuscript is disfigured by
corrections, a few by the original scribe, or by the usual comparer
or διορθώτης (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg055" class="tei tei-ref">55</a>); very many by an ancient and
elegant hand of the sixth century (א<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span>), whose emendations are of

The foregoing considerations were bringing even cautious
students to a general conviction that Cod. א, if not, as its enthusiastic
discoverer had announced, <span class="tei tei-q">“omnium antiquissimus”</span>
in the absolute sense of the words, was yet but little lower in
date than the Vatican manuscript itself, and a veritable relic of
the middle of the fourth century—the presence in its margin of
the sections and canons of Eusebius [d. 340?], by a hand nearly
if not quite contemporaneous, seems to preclude the notion of
higher antiquity<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>—when Constantino Simonides, a Greek of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Syme, who had just edited a few papyrus fragments of the
New Testament alleged to have been written in the first
century of the Christian era, suddenly astonished the learned
world in 1862 by claiming to be himself the scribe who had
penned this manuscript in the monastery of Panteleemon on
Mount Athos, as recently as in the years 1839 and 1840.
The writer of these pages must refer to the Introduction to his
Collation of the Codex Sinaiticus (pp. lx-lxxii, 2nd edition,
1867) for a statement of the reasons which have been universally
accepted as conclusive, why the manuscript which
Simonides may very well have written under the circumstances
he has described neither was nor possibly could be that venerable
document. The discussion of the whole question, however,
though painful enough in some aspects, was the means of
directing attention to certain peculiarities of Cod. א which
might otherwise have been overlooked. While engaged in
demonstrating that it could not have been transcribed from a
Moscow-printed Bible, as was <span class="tei tei-q">“Cod. Simoneidos”</span> (to borrow the
designation employed by its author), critics came to perceive
that either this copy or its immediate prototype must have
been derived from a papyrus exemplar, and that probably of
Egyptian origin (Collation, &amp;c. pp. viii; xiv; lxviii), a confirmation
of the impression conveyed to the reader by a first
glance at the eight narrow columns of each open leaf (p. 28).
The claim of Simonides to be the sole writer of a book which
must have consisted when complete of about 730 leaves, or
1460 pages of very large size (Collation, &amp;c. p. xxxii), and that
too within the compass of eight or ten months<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> (he inscribed on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his finished work, as he tells us, the words Σιμωνίδου τὸ ὅλον
ἔργον), made it important to scrutinize the grounds of Tischendorf's
judgement that four several scribes had been engaged
upon it, one of whom, as he afterwards came to persuade himself,
was the writer of its rival, Codex Vaticanus<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>. Such an
investigation, so far as it depends only on the handwriting, can
scarcely be carried out satisfactorily without actual examination
of the manuscript itself, which is unfortunately not easily
within the reach of those who could use it independently; but
it is at all events quite plain, as well from internal considerations
as from minute peculiarities in the writing, such as the
frequent use of the apostrophus and of the mark &gt; (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see above</span></span>,
p. <a href="#Pg050" class="tei tei-ref">50</a>) on some sheets and their complete absence from others
(Collation, &amp;c. pp. xvi-xviii; xxxii; xxxvii), that at least
two, and probably more, persons have been employed on the
several parts of the volume<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a>.

It is indeed a strange coincidence, although unquestionably it
can be nothing more, that Simonides should have brought to the
West from Mount Athos some years before one genuine fragment
of the Shepherd of Hermas in Greek, and the transcript of
a second (both of which materially aided Tischendorf in editing
the remains of that Apostolic Father), when taken in connexion
with the fact that the worth of Codex Sinaiticus is vastly
enhanced by its exhibiting next to the Apocalypse, and on the
same page with its conclusion, the only complete extant copy,
besides the one discovered by Bryennios in 1875, of the Epistle of
Barnabas in Greek, followed by a considerable portion of this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
self-same Shepherd of Hermas, much of which, as well as of
Barnabas, was previously known to us only in the Old Latin
translation. Both these works are included in the list of books
of the New Testament contained in the great Codex Claromontanus
D of St. Paul's Epistles, to be described hereafter, Barnabas
standing there in an order sufficiently remarkable; and their
presence, like that of the Epistles of Clement at the end of
Codex Alexandrinus (p. <a href="#Pg099" class="tei tei-ref">99</a>), brings us back to a time when
the Church had not yet laid aside the primitive custom of reading
publicly in the congregation certain venerated writings
which have never been regarded exactly in the same light as
Holy Scripture itself. Between the end of Barnabas and
the opening of the Shepherd are lost the last six leaves of
a quaternion (which usually consists of eight) numbered 91
at its head in a fairly ancient hand. The limited space would
not suffice for the insertion of Clement's genuine Epistle, since
the head of the next quaternion is numbered 92, but might suit
one of the other uncanonical books on the list in Cod. Claromontanus,
viz. the Acts of Paul and the Revelation of Peter.

With regard to the deeply interesting question as to the critical
character of Cod. א, although it strongly supports the Codex
Vaticanus in many characteristic readings, yet it cannot be said
to give its exclusive adherence to any of the witnesses hitherto
examined. It so lends its grave authority, now to one and now
to another, as to convince us more than ever of the futility of
seeking to derive the genuine text of the New Testament from
any one copy, however ancient and, on the whole, trustworthy,
when evidence of a wide and varied character is at hand.

open volume of the New Testament is publicly shown in the
Manuscript room. It was placed in that Library on its formation
in 1753, having previously belonged to the king's private
collection from the year 1628, when Cyril Lucar, Patriarch of
Constantinople (whose crude attempts to reform the Eastern
Church on the model of Geneva ultimately provoked the untoward
Synod of Bethlehem in 1672<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a>), sent this most precious

document by our Ambassador in Turkey, Sir Thomas Roe,
as a truly royal gift to Charles I. An Arabic inscription,
several centuries old, at the back of the Table of Contents on
the first leaf of the manuscript, and translated into Latin in
another hand, which Mr. W. Aldis Wright recognizes as Bentley's
(Academy, April 17, 1875), states that it was written by the
hand of Thecla the Martyr<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a>. A recent Latin note on the first
page of the first of two fly-leaves declares that it was given
to the Patriarchal Chamber in the year of the Martyrs, 814
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1098]. Another, and apparently the earliest inscription, in
an obscure Moorish-Arabic scrawl, set at the foot of the first page
of Genesis, was thus translated for Baber by Professor Nicoll of
Oxford, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dicatus est Cellae Patriarchae in urbe munitâ Alexandriâ.
Qui eum ex eâ extraxerit sit anathematizatus, vi avulsus.
Athanasius humilis”</span> (Cod. Alex. V.T., Prolegomena, p. xxvi,
note 92). That the book was brought from Alexandria by Cyril
(who had been Patriarch of that see from 1602 to 1621) need
not be disputed, although Wetstein, on the doubtful authority of
Matthew Muttis of Cyprus, Cyril's deacon, concludes that he
procured it from Mount Athos. In the volume itself the
Patriarch has written and subscribed the following words:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Liber iste scripturae sacrae N. et V. Testamenti, prout ex
traditione habemus, est scriptus manu Theclae, nobilis foeminae
Aegyptiae, ante mile [sic] et trecentos annos circiter, paulò post

sed extincto Christianismo in Aegypto a Mahometanis, et libri
unà Christianorum in similem sunt reducti conditionem. Extinctum
ergo est Theclae nomen et laceratum, sed memoria et
traditio recens observat.”</span> Cyril seems to lean wholly on the
Arabic inscription on the first leaf of the volume: independent
testimony he would appear to have received none.

This celebrated manuscript, the earliest of first-rate importance

Testament with several lamentable defects. In St. Matthew's
Gospel some twenty-five leaves are wanting up to ch. xxv. 6
ἐξέρχεσθε, from John vi. 50 ἵνα to viii. 52 καὶ σύ<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> two leaves are
lost, and three leaves from 2 Cor. iv. 13 ἐπίστευσα to xii. 6 ἐξ
ἐμοῦ. All the other books of the New Testament are here entire,
the Catholic Epistles following the Acts, that to the Hebrews
standing before the Pastoral Epistles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg074" class="tei tei-ref">74</a>). After
the Apocalypse we find what was till very recently the only
known extant copy of the first or genuine Epistle of Clement of
Rome, and a small fragment of a second of suspected authenticity,
both in the same hand as the latter part of the New Testament.
It would appear also that these two Epistles of Clement were
designed to form a part of the volume of Scripture, for in the
Table of Contents exhibited on the first leaf of the manuscript
under the head Η ΚΑΙΝΗ ΔΙΑΘΗΚΗ, they are represented as
immediately following the Apocalypse: next is given the number
of books, ΟΜΟΥ ΒΙΒΛΙΑ, the numerals being now illegible;
and after this, as if distinct from Scripture, the eighteen Psalms
of Solomon. Such uncanonical works (ἰδιωτικοὶ ψαλμοὶ ... ἀκανόνιστα
βιβλία) were forbidden to be read in churches by the
59th canon of the Council of Laodicea (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 363?); whose 60th
canon, which seems to have been added a little later, enumerates
the books of the N. T. in the precise order seen in Cod. A,
only that the Apocalypse and Clement's Epistles do not stand
on the list.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This manuscript is in quarto, 12-¾ inches high and 10-¼ broad,
and consists of 773 leaves (of which 639 contain the Old Testament),
each page being divided into two columns of fifty or
fifty-one lines each, having about twenty letters or upwards in
a line. These letters are written continuously in uncial characters,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
without any space between the words, the uncials being
of an elegant yet simple form, in a firm and uniform hand,
though in some places larger than in others. Specimens of
both styles may be seen in our facsimiles (Plate <a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref">v</a>, Nos. 12, 13)<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>,
the first, Gen. i. 1, 2, being written in vermilion, the second,
Acts xx. 28, in the once black, but now yellowish-brown ink of
the body of the Codex. The punctuation, which no later hand
has meddled with, consists merely of a point placed at the end
of a sentence, usually on a level with the top of the preceding
letter, but not always; and a vacant space follows the point at
the end of a paragraph, the space being proportioned to the
break in the sense. Capital letters of various sizes abound at
the beginning of books and sections, not painted as in later
copies, but written by the original scribe in common ink. As
these capitals stand entirely outside the column in the margin
(excepting in such rare cases as Gen. i. 1), if the section begins
in the middle of a line, the capital is necessarily postponed till
the beginning of the next line, whose first letter is always the
capital, even though it be in the middle of a word (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg051" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>).
Vermilion is freely used in the initial lines of books, and has
stood the test of time much better than the black ink: the first
four lines of each column on the first page of Genesis are in this
colour, accompanied with the only breathings and accents in
the manuscript (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see above</span></span>, pp. <a href="#Pg045" class="tei tei-ref">45</a>, <a href="#Pg046" class="tei tei-ref">46</a>). The first line of St. Mark,
the first three of St. Luke, the first verse of St. John, the opening
of the Acts down to δι, and so on for other books, are in vermilion.
At the end of each book are neat and unique ornaments
in the ink of the first hand: see especially those at the
end of St. Mark and the Acts. As we have before stated this
codex is the earliest which has the κεφάλαια proper, the so-called
Ammonian sections, and the Eusebian canons complete.
Lists of the κεφάλαια precede each Gospel, except the first, where
they are lost. Their titles stand or have stood at the top of the
pages, but the binder has often ruthlessly cut them short, and
committed other yet more serious mutilation at the edges. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
places at which they begin are indicated throughout, and their
numbers are moreover set in the margin of Luke and John.
The sections and Eusebian canons are conspicuous in the margin,
and at the beginning of each of these sections a capital letter is
found. The rest of the New Testament has no division into
κεφάλαια, as was usual in later times, but paragraphs and capitals
occur as the sense requires.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The palaeographic reasons for assigning this manuscript to
the beginning or middle of the fifth century (the date now very
generally acquiesced in, though it may be referred even to the
end of the fourth century, and is certainly not much later)
depend in part on the general style of the writing, which is at
once firm, elegant and simple; partly on the formation of certain
letters, in which respect it holds a middle place between copies
of the fourth and sixth centuries. The reader will recall what
we have already said (pp. <a href="#Pg033" class="tei tei-ref">33-40</a>) as to the shape of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sigma</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phi</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omega</span></span> in the Codex Alexandrinus.
Woide, who edited the New Testament, believes that two hands
were employed in that volume, changing in the page containing
1 Cor. v-vii, the vellum of the latter portion being thinner and
the ink more thick, so that it has peeled off or eaten through
the vellum in many places. This, however, is a point on which
those who know manuscripts best will most hesitate to speak
decidedly<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The external arguments for fixing the date are less weighty,
but all point to the same conclusion. On the evidence for its
being written by St. Thecla, indeed, no one has cared to lay
much stress, though some have thought that the scribe might
belong to a monastery dedicated to that holy martyr<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a>, whether
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the contemporary of St. Paul be meant, or her namesake who
suffered in the second year of Diocletian, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 286 (Eusebius de
Martyr. Palaestin. c. iii). Tregelles explains the origin of the
Arabic inscription, on which Cyril's statement appears to rest, by
remarking that the New Testament in our manuscript at present
commences with Matt. xxv. 6, this lesson (Matt. xxv. 1-13) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">being
that appointed by the Greek Church for the festival of St. Thecla</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see above</span></span>, Menology, p. <a href="#Pg087" class="tei tei-ref">87</a>, Sept. 24). Thus the Egyptian who
wrote this Arabic note, observing the name of Thecla in the
now mutilated upper margin of the Codex, where such rubrical
notes are commonly placed by later hands, may have hastily
concluded that she wrote the book, and so perplexed our Biblical
critics. It seems a fatal objection to this shrewd conjecture, as
Mr. E. Maunde Thompson points out, that the Arabic numeration
of the leaf, set in the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">verso</span></span> of the lower margin, itself posterior
in date to the Arabic note relating to Thecla, is 26<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a>; so that the
twenty-five leaves now lost must have been still extant when
that note was written.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other more trustworthy reasons for assigning Cod. A to the
fifth century may be summed up very briefly. The presence of
the canons of Eusebius [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 268-340?], and of the epistle to
Marcellinus by the great Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria
[300?-373], standing before the Psalms, place a limit in one
direction, while the absence of the Euthalian divisions of the
Acts and Epistles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg064" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>), which came into vogue very
soon after <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 458, and the shortness of the ὑπογραφαί (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>,
p. <a href="#Pg065" class="tei tei-ref">65</a>), appear tolerably decisive against a later date than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 450.
The insertion of the Epistles of Clement, like that of the treatises
of Barnabas and Hermas in the Cod. Sinaiticus (p. <a href="#Pg092" class="tei tei-ref">92</a>), recalls
us to a period when the canon of Scripture was in some particulars
a little unsettled, that is, about the age of the Councils of
Laodicea (363?) and of Carthage (397). Other arguments have
been urged both for an earlier and a later date, but they scarcely
deserve discussion. Wetstein's objection to the name Θεοτόκος as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
applied to the Blessed Virgin in the title to her song, added to
the Psalms, is quite groundless: that appellation was given to
her by both the Gregories in the middle of the fourth century
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vid.</span></span> Suicer, Thesaur. Eccles. i. p. 1387), as habitually as it was
a century after: nor should we insist much on the contrary
upon Woide's or Schulz's persuasion that the τρισάγιον (ἅγιος
ὁ θεός, ἅγιος ἰσχυρός, ἅγιος ἀθάνατος) would have been found in
the ὕμνος ἑωθινός after the Psalms, had the manuscript been
written as late as the fifth century.

of this manuscript were made by Patrick Young, Librarian to
Charles I<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>, who first published from it the Epistles of Clement

J. E. Grabe, the second and third of his four volumes being

In 1786, Charles Godfrey Woide, preacher at the Dutch
Chapel Royal and Assistant Librarian in the British Museum,
a distinguished Coptic scholar [d. 1790], published, by the aid
of 456 subscribers, a noble folio edition of the New Testament
from this manuscript, with valuable Prolegomena, a copy of the
text which, so far as it has been tested, has been found reasonably
accurate, together with notes on the changes made in the codex
by later hands, and a minute collation of its readings with the
common text as presented in Kuster's edition of Mill's N. T.
(1710). In this last point Woide has not been taken as a model
by subsequent editors of manuscripts, much to the inconvenience
of the student. In 1816-28 the Old Testament portion of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Codex Alexandrinus was published in three folio volumes at the
national expense, by the Rev. Henry Hervey Baber, also of the
British Museum, the Prolegomena to whose magnificent work
are very inferior to Woide's, but contain some additional information.
Both these performances, and many others like them
which we shall have to describe, are printed in an uncial type,
bearing some general resemblance to that of their respective
originals, but which must not be supposed to convey any
adequate notion of their actual appearance. Such quasi-facsimiles
(for they are nothing more), while they add to the
cost of the book, seem to answer no useful purpose whatever;
and, if taken by an incautious reader for more than they profess
to be, will seriously mislead him. In 1860 Mr. B. H. Cowper
put forth an octavo edition of the New Testament pages in
common type, but burdened with modern breathings and
accents, the lacunae of the manuscript being unwisely supplied
by means of Kuster's edition of Mill, and the original paragraphs
departed from, wheresoever they were judged to be inconvenient.
These obvious faults are the more to be regretted, inasmuch as
Mr. Cowper has not shrunk from the labour of revising Woide's
edition by a comparison with the Codex itself, thus giving to his
book a distinctive value of its own. An admirable autotype
facsimile of the New Testament was published in 1879, and
afterwards of the Old Testament, by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson,
then the Principal Keeper of Manuscripts, now the Principal
Librarian, of the British Museum.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Codex Alexandrinus has been judged to be carelessly
written; many errors of transcription no doubt exist, but not
so many as in some copies (e.g. Cod. א), nor more than in others
(as Cod. B). None other than the ordinary abridgements
are found in it (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> pp. <a href="#Pg049" class="tei tei-ref">49-50</a>): numerals are not expressed by
letters except in Apoc. vii. 4; xxi. 17: ι and υ have usually
the dots over them at the beginning of a syllable. Of itacisms
it may be doubted whether it contains more than others of
the same date: the interchange of ι and ει, η and ι, ε, αι, are the
most frequent; but these mutations are too common to prove
anything touching the country of the manuscript. Its external
history renders it very likely that it was written at Alexandria,
that great manufactory of correct and elegant copies, while
Egypt was yet a Christian land: but such forms as λήμψομαι,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ἐλάβαμεν, ἦλθαν, ἔνατος, ἐκαθερίσθη, and others named by Woide,
are peculiar to no single nation, but are found repeatedly in
Greek-Latin codices which unquestionably originated in Western
Europe. This manuscript is of the very greatest importance to
the critic, inasmuch as it exhibits (especially in the Gospels) a text
more nearly approaching that found in later copies than is read
in others of its high antiquity, although some of its errors are
portentous enough, e.g. θ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">υ</span></span> for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ιυ</span></span> in John xix. 40. This topic,
however, will be discussed at length in another place, and we
shall elsewhere consider the testimony Codex A bears in the
celebrated passage 1 Tim. iii. 16.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Vaticanus</span></span> 1209 is probably the oldest large vellum
manuscript in existence, and is the glory of the great Vatican
Library at Rome. To this legitimate source of deep interest
must be added the almost romantic curiosity which was once
excited by the jealous watchfulness of its official guardians.
But now that an acquaintance with it has been placed within
the reach of scholars through the magnificent autotype edition
issued by the authorities of the Vatican, it may be hoped that
all such mystic glamour will soon be left with the past.
This book seems to have been brought into the Vatican
Library shortly after its establishment by Pope Nicolas V in
1448, but nothing is known of its previous history<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>. It is
entered in the earliest catalogue of that Library, made in
1475. Since the missing portions at the end of the New
Testament are believed to have been supplied in the fifteenth
century from a manuscript belonging to Cardinal Bessarion, we
may be allowed to conjecture, if we please, that this learned
Greek brought the Codex into the west of Europe. It was
taken to Paris by Napoleon I, where it was studied by Hug in
1809. Although this book has not even yet been as thoroughly
collated, or rendered as available as it might be to the critical
student, its general character and appearance are sufficiently well
known. It is a quarto volume, arranged in quires of five sheets
or ten leaves each, like Codex Marchalianus of the Prophets
written in the sixth or seventh century and Cod. Rossanensis of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Gospels to be described hereafter, not of four or three
sheets as Cod. א, the ancient, perhaps the original, numbering
of the quires being often found in the margin. The New
Testament fills 142 out of its 759 thin and delicate vellum
leaves, said to be made of the skins of antelopes: it is
bound in red morocco, being 10-½ inches high, 10 broad,
4-½ thick. It once contained the whole Bible in Greek, the
Old Testament of the Septuagint version (a tolerably fair representation
of which was exhibited in the Roman edition as early
as 1587<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a>), except the books of the Maccabees and the Prayer of
Manasses. The first forty-six chapters of Genesis (the manuscript
begins at πολιν, Gen. xlvi. 28) and Psalms cv-cxxxvii, also the
books of the Maccabees, are wanting. The New Testament is
complete down to Heb. ix. 14 καθα: the rest of the Epistle
to the Hebrews (the Catholic Epistles had followed the Acts,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg074" class="tei tei-ref">74</a>), and the Apocalypse, being written in the later hand
alluded to above. The peculiar arrangement of three columns on
a page, or six on the opened leaf of the volume, is described by
eye-witnesses as very striking: in the poetical books of the
Old Testament (since they are written στιχηρῶς) only two
columns fill a page. Our facsimile (Plate <a href="#Plate_VIII" class="tei tei-ref">viii</a>, No. 20) comprises
Mark xvi. 3 μιν τον λιθον to the end of verse 8, where
the Gospel ends abruptly; both the arabesque ornament and
the subscription ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ being in a later hand (for M
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg037" class="tei tei-ref">37</a>). All who have inspected the Codex are loud in
their praises of the fine thin vellum, the clear and elegant
hand of the first penman, the simplicity of the whole style of
the work: capital letters, so frequent in the Codex Alexandrinus,
were totally wanting in this document for some centuries.
In several of these particulars our manuscript resembles the
Herculanean rolls, and thus asserts a just claim to high antiquity,
which the absence of the divisions into κεφάλαια, of the sections
and canons, and the substitution in their room of another scheme
of chapters of its own (described above, p. <a href="#Pg056" class="tei tei-ref">56</a>), beyond question
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tend very powerfully to confirm. Each column contains
ordinarily forty-two lines<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>, each line from sixteen to eighteen
letters, of a size somewhat less than in Cod. A, much less than
in Cod. א (though they all vary a little in this respect), with no
intervals between words, a space of the breadth of half a letter
being left at the end of a sentence, and a little more at the
conclusion of a paragraph; the first letter of the new sentence
occasionally standing a little out of the line (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> pp. <a href="#Pg051" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>, <a href="#Pg093" class="tei tei-ref">93</a>). It
has been doubted whether any of the stops are <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>,
and (contrary to the judgement of Birch and others) the breathings
and accents are now universally allowed to have been added
by a later hand. This hand, referred by some to the eighth
century (although Tischendorf, with Dr. Hort's approval, assigns
it to the tenth or eleventh<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>), retraced, with as much care as such
an operation would permit, the faint lines of the original writing
(the ink whereof was perhaps never quite black), the remains of
which can even now be seen by a keen-sighted reader by the
side of the thicker and more modern strokes; and, anxious at
the same time to represent a critical revision of the text, the
writer left untouched such words or letters as he wished to
reject. In these last places, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where no breathings or accents and
scarcely any stops</span><a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a><span style="font-style: italic"> have ever been detected</span></em>, we have an opportunity
of seeing the manuscript in its primitive condition,
before it had been tampered with by the later scribe. There
are occasional breaks in the continuity of the writing, every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
descent in the genealogies of our Lord (Matt. i, Luke iii<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a>), each
of the beatitudes (Matt. v), of the parables in Matt. xiii, and
the salutations of Rom. xvi, forming a separate paragraph; but
such a case will oftentimes not occur for several consecutive
pages. The writer's plan was to proceed regularly with a book
until it was finished: then to break off from the column he was
writing, and to begin the next book on the very next column.
Thus only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> column perfectly blank is found in the whole
New Testament<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>, that which follows ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ in Mark
xvi. 8: and since Cod. B is the only one yet known, except
Cod. א, that actually omits the last twelve verses of that
Gospel, by leaving such a space the scribe has intimated that
he was fully aware of their existence, or even found them in
the copy from which he wrote. The capital letters at the
beginning of each book are likewise due to the corrector,
who sometimes erased, sometimes merely touched slightly,
the original initial letter, which (as in the Herculanean rolls)
is no larger than any other. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">paragraph</span></em> marks (usually
straight lines, but sometimes [symbol]<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>) are seen quite frequently in
some parts; whether from the first hand is very doubtful. The
note of citation &gt; is perpetual, not occasional as in Cod. א.
Fewer abridgements than usual occur in this venerable copy.

point to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">fourth</span></span> century as the date of this manuscript.
The smaller letters so often found at the end of lines preserve
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the same firm and simple character as the rest; of the use of
the apostrophus, so frequent in Codd. א, A and some others,
Tischendorf enumerates ten instances in the New Testament
(N. T. Vatican. Proleg. p. xxi), whereof four are represented in
the Roman edition of 1868, with two more which Tischendorf
considers as simple points (Acts vii. 13, 14).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tischendorf says truly enough that something like a history
might be written of the futile attempts to collate Cod. B, and
a very unprofitable history it would be. The manuscript is first
distinctly heard of (for it does not appear to have been used for
the Complutensian Polyglott<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>) through Sepulveda, to whose
correspondence with Erasmus attention has been seasonably
recalled by Tregelles. Writing in 1533, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Est enim
Graecum exemplar antiquissimum in Bibliothecâ Vaticanâ, in quo
diligentissimè et accuratissimè literis majusculis conscriptum
utrumque Testamentum continetur longè diversum a vulgatis
exemplaribus”</span>: and, after noticing as a weighty proof of
excellence its agreement with the Latin version (multum
convenit cum vetere nostrâ translatione) against the common
Greek text (vulgatam Graecorum editionem), he furnishes
Erasmus with 365 readings as a convincing argument in support
of his statements. It would probably be from this list
that in his Annotations to the Acts, published in 1535, Erasmus
cites the reading καῦδα, ch. xxvii. 16 (<span class="tei tei-q">“quidam admonent”</span> is
the expression he uses), from a Greek codex in the Pontifical
Library, since for this reading Cod. B is the only known <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></em>
witness, except a corrector of Cod. א. It seems, however, that
he had obtained some account of this manuscript from the Papal
Librarian Paul Bombasius as early as 1521 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Wetstein's
Proleg. N. T., vol. i. p. 23). Lucas Brugensis, who published
his Notationes in S. Biblia in 1580, and his Commentary on
the Four Gospels (dedicated to Cardinal Bellarmine) in 1606,
made known some twenty extracts from Cod. B taken by
Werner of Nimeguen; that most imperfect collection being the
only source from which Mill and even Wetstein had any
acquaintance with the contents of this first-rate document.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
More indeed might have been gleaned from the Barberini
readings gathered in or about 1625 (of which we shall speak
in the next section), but their real value and character were not
known in the lifetime of Wetstein. In 1698 Lorenzo Alexander
Zacagni, Librarian of the Vatican, in his Preface to the Collectanea
Monumentorum Veterum Eccles., describes Cod. B, and
especially its peculiar division into sections, in a passage cited
by Mill (Proleg. § 1480). In 1669 indeed the first real collation
of the manuscript with the Aldine edition (1518) had been
attempted by Bartolocci, then Librarian of the Vatican; from
some accident, however, it was never published, though a transcript
under the feigned name of Giulio a Sta. Anastasia
yet remains in the Imperial Library of Paris (MSS. Gr.
Supplem. 53), where it was first discovered and used by Scholz
in 1819, and subsequently by Tischendorf and Muralt, the latter
of whom (apparently on but slender grounds) regards it as the
best hitherto made; others have declared it to be very imperfect,
and quite inferior to those of Bentley and Birch. The
collation which bears Bentley's name (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 3,
in Cephalaeus' N. T. 1524) was procured about 1720 by his
money and the labour of the Abbate Mico, for the purpose of
his projected Greek Testament. When he had found out its
defects, by means of an examination of the original by his
nephew Thomas Bentley in 1726, our great critic engaged the
Abbate Rulotta in 1729 for forty scudi (Bentley's Correspondence,
p. 706) to revise Mico's sheets, and especially to note the
changes made by the second hand. Rulotta's papers came to
light in 1855 among the Bentley manuscripts in the Library of
Trinity College, Cambridge (B. xvii. 20), and have lately proved
of signal value<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>; Mico's were published in 1799 at Oxford, by
Henry Ford, Lord Almoner's Reader in Arabic there (1783-1813),
together with some Thebaic fragments of the New
Testament, in a volume which (since it was chiefly drawn from
Woide's posthumous papers) he was pleased to call an Appendix
to the Codex Alexandrinus. A fourth collation of the Vatican
MS. was made about 1780 by Andrew Birch of Copenhagen,
and is included in the notes to the first volume of his Greek
Testament 1788, or published separately in three volumes which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were issued successively 1798 (Acts, Cath. Epp., Paul.), 1800
(Apoc.), and 1801 (Evans). Birch's collation does not extend
to the Gospels of St. Luke and St. John, and on the whole is less
full and exact than Mico's. In 1810, however, when, with the
other best treasures of the Vatican, Codex B was at Paris, the
celebrated critic J. L. Hug sent forth his treatise <span class="tei tei-q">“de Antiquitate
Vaticani Codicis Commentatio,”</span> and though even he did not
perceive the need of a new and full collation when he examined
it in 1809, he has the merit of first placing it in the paramount
rank it still holds as one of the oldest and most venerable of
extant monuments of sacred antiquity. His conclusion respecting
its date, that it is not later than the middle of the fourth century,
has been acquiesced in with little opposition, though Tischendorf
declares rather pithily that he holds this belief <span class="tei tei-q">“non propter
Hugium sed cum Hugio”</span> (Cod. Ephraem. Proleg. p. 19). Some
of his reasons, no doubt, are weak enough<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a>; but the strength of
his position depends on an accumulation of minute particulars,
against which there seems nothing to set up which would suggest
a lower period. On its return to Rome, this volume was no
longer available for the free use and reference of critics. In
1843 Tischendorf, after long and anxious expectation during
a visit to Rome that lasted some months, obtained a sight of it
for two days of three hours each<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a>. In 1844 Edward de Muralt
was admitted to the higher privilege of three days or nine hours
enjoyment of this treasure, and on the strength of the favour
published an edition of the New Testament, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad fidem codicis
principis Vaticani</span></span>, in 1846. Tregelles, who went to Rome in
1845 for the special purpose of consulting it, was treated even
worse. He had forearmed himself (as he fondly imagined) with
recommendatory letters from Cardinal Wiseman, and was often
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
allowed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></em> the manuscript, but hindered from transcribing
any of its readings<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What the Papal authorities would not entrust to others,
they had at least the merit of attempting and at length accomplishing
themselves. As early as 1836 Bishop Wiseman
announced in his Lectures on the Connection between Science
and Revelation, vol. ii. pp. 187-191, that Cardinal Mai, whose
services to classical and ecclesiastical literature were renowned
throughout Europe, was engaged on an edition of the Codex
Vaticanus, commenced under the immediate sanction of Pope
Leo XII (1823-29). As years passed by and no such work
appeared, adverse reports and evil surmises began to take the
place of hope, although the Cardinal often spoke of his work as
already finished, only that he desired to write full Prolegomena
before it should appear. In September 1854 he died, honoured
and ripe in years; and at length, when no more seemed to be
looked for in that quarter, five quarto volumes issued from the
Roman press in 1857, the New Testament comprising the fifth
volume, with a slight and meagre preface by the Cardinal, and
a letter to the reader by <span class="tei tei-q">“Carolus Vercellone, Sodalis Barnabites,”</span>
which told in a few frank manly words how little accuracy we
had to expect in a work, by the publication of which he still
persuaded himself he was decorating Mai's memory <span class="tei tei-q">“novâ usque
gloriâ atque splendidiore coronâ”</span> (tom. i. p. iii). The cause of
that long delay now required no explanation. In fact so long
as Mai lived the edition never would have appeared; for though
he had not patience or special skill enough to accomplish his
task well, he was too good a scholar not to know that he had
done it very ill. The text is broken up into paragraphs, the
numbers of the modern chapters and verses being placed in the
margin; the peculiar divisions of the Codex Vaticanus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg056" class="tei tei-ref">56</a>)
sometimes omitted, sometimes tampered with. The Greek type
employed is not an imitation of the uncials in the manuscript
(of which circumstance we do not complain), but has modern
stops, breathings, accents, ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscript</span></span>, &amp;c., as if the venerable
document were written yesterday. As regards the orthography
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is partially, and only partially, modernized; clauses or whole
passages omitted in the manuscript are supplied from other
sources, although the fact is duly notified<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>; sometimes the
readings of the first hand are put in the margin, while those of
the second stand in the text, sometimes the contrary: in a word,
the plan of the work exhibits all the faults such a performance
well can have. Nor is the execution at all less objectionable.
Although the five volumes were ten years in printing (1828-38),
Mai devoted to their superintendence only his scanty spare
hours, and even then worked so carelessly that after cancelling
a hundred pages for their incurable want of exactness, he was
reduced to the shift of making <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manual</span></em> corrections with moveable
types, and projected huge tables of errata, which Vercellone has
in some measure tried to supply. When once it is stated that
the type was set up from the common Elzevir or from some
other printed Greek Testament, the readings of the Codex itself
being inserted as corrections, and the whole revised by means of
an assistant who read the proof-sheets to the Cardinal while he
inspected the manuscript; no one will look for accuracy from
a method which could not possibly lead to it. Accordingly,
when Mai's text came to be compared with the collations of
Bartolocci, of Mico, of Rulotta, and of Birch, or with the
scattered readings which had been extracted by others, it was
soon discovered that while this edition added very considerably
to our knowledge of the Codex Vaticanus, and often enabled us
to form a decision on its readings when the others were at
variance; it was in its turn convicted by them of so many
errors, oversights, and inconsistencies, that its single evidence
could never be used with confidence, especially when it agreed
with the commonly received Greek text. Immediately after the
appearance of Mai's expensive quartos, an octavo reprint of the
New Testament was struck off at Leipsic for certain London
booksellers, which proved but a hasty, slovenly, unscholarlike
performance, and was put aside in 1859 by a cheap Roman
edition in octavo, prepared, as was the quarto, by Mai, prefaced
by another graceful and sensible epistle of Vercellone<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a>. This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
last edition was undertaken by the Cardinal, after sad experience
had taught him the defects of his larger work, and he took good
care to avoid some of the worst of them: the readings of the
second hand are usually, though not always, banished to the
margin, their number on the whole is increased, gross errors are
corrected, omissions supplied, and the Vatican chapters are
given faithfully and in full. But Mai's whole procedure in this
matter is so truly unfortunate, that in a person whose fame
was less solidly grounded, we should impute it to mere helpless
incapacity<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a>. Not only did he split up the paragraphs of his
quarto into the modern chapters and verses (in itself a most
undesirable change, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg070" class="tei tei-ref">70</a>), but by omitting some
things and altering others, he introduced almost as many errors
as he removed. When Dean Burgon was permitted to examine
the Codex for an hour and a half in 1860, on consulting it for
sixteen passages out of hundreds wherein the two are utterly at
variance, he discovered that the quarto was right in seven of
them, the octavo in nine: as if Mai were determined that
neither of his editions should supersede the use of the other.
Dean Alford also collated numerous passages in 1861<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>, and his
secretary Mr. Cure in 1862, especially with reference to the
several correcting hands: <span class="tei tei-q">“in errorem quidem et ipse haud raro
inductus,”</span> is Tischendorf's verdict on his labours. Thus critics
of every shade of opinion became unanimous on one point, that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a new edition of the Codex Vaticanus was as imperatively
needed as ever; one which should preserve with accuracy all
that the first hand has written (transcriptural errors included),
should note in every instance the corrections made by the
second hand, and, wherever any one of the previous collators
might be found in error, should expressly state the true reading.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would have been a grievous reproach had no efforts been
made to supply so great and acknowledged a want. Early in
1866, Tischendorf again visited Rome, and when admitted into
the presence of Pope Pius IX, boldly sought permission to edit
at his own cost such an edition of Cod. B as he had already
published of Cod. א. The request was denied by his Holiness,
who obscurely hinted his intention of carrying out the same
design on his own account. Tischendorf, however, obtained
permission to use the manuscript so far as to consult it in
such parts of the New Testament as presented any special
difficulty, or respecting which previous collators were at
variance. He commenced his task February 28, and in the
course of it could not refrain from copying at length twenty
pages of the great Codex—nineteen from the New Testament,
and one from the Old. This licence was not unnaturally
regarded as a breach of his contract, so that, after he had used
the manuscript for eight days, it was abruptly withdrawn from
him on March 12. An appeal to the generosity of Vercellone,
who had been entrusted with the care of the forthcoming edition,
procured for him the sight of this coveted treasure for six days
longer between March 20 and 26, the Italian being always
present on these latter occasions, and receiving instruction for
the preparation of his own work by watching the processes
of a master hand. Thus fourteen days of three hours each,
used zealously and skilfully, enabled Tischendorf to put forth
an edition of Cod. B far superior to any that preceded it<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a>. The
Prolegomena are full of matter from which we have drawn
freely in the foregoing description, the text is in cursive type,
the nineteen pages which cost him so dearly being arranged in
their proper lines, the remainder according to columns. Much
that ought to have been noted was doubtless passed over by
Tischendorf for mere pressure of time; but he takes great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pains to distinguish the readings of the original writer or his
διορθωτής (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg055" class="tei tei-ref">55</a>)<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>, both of whom supplied words or letters
here and there in the margin or between the lines<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>, from the
corrections of a second yet ancient scribe (B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>), and those of
the person (B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></span>) who retraced the faded writing at a later period<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a>.
One notion, taken up by Tischendorf in the course of his
collation in 1866, was received at first with general incredulity
by other scholars. He has pronounced a decided opinion,
not only that Codd. א and B are documents of the same
age, but that the scribe who wrote the latter is one of the
four [D] to whose diligence we owe the former. That there
should be a general similarity in the style of the two great
codices is probable enough, although the letters in Cod. א are
about half as large again as those of its fellow, but such as are
aware of the difficulty of arriving at a safe conclusion as to
identity of penmanship after close and repeated comparison of
one document with another, will hardly attach much weight to
the impression of any person, however large his experience,
who has nothing but memory to trust to. Tregelles, who has
also seen both copies, states that Cod. א looks much the fresher
and clearer of the two. Yet the reasons alleged above, which
are quite independent of the appearance of the handwriting,
leave scarcely a doubt that Tischendorf's judgement was correct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman edition, projected by Vercellone and Cozza
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under the auspices of Pius IX, was designed to consist of six
volumes, four containing the Old Testament, one the New,
another being devoted to the notes and discrimination of corrections
by later hands. The New Testament appeared in 1868<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>,
a second volume in 1869, containing the text from Genesis to
Joshua; three more have since completed the Old Testament
(1870, 1871, 1872). The learned, genial, and modest Vercellone
(b. 1814) died early in 1869, so that the later volumes bear on
their title-page the mournful inscription <span class="tei tei-q">“Carolum Vercellone
excepit Caietanus Sergio Sodalis Barnabites”</span> as Cozza's associate.
These editors fared but ill whether as Biblical critics or as general
scholars, under the rough handling of Tischendorf, whom the
wiser policy of Vercellone had kept in good humour, but whose
powers his successors greatly undervalued. There seems, however,
to be no great cause, in spite of their adversary's minute
diligence in fault-finding (Appendix N. T. Vatic. 1869, p. xi,
&amp;c.)<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>, for doubting their general correctness, although they
persist in placing on the page with the rest of their text readings
which are known or credibly stated to be of decidedly
later date, in spite of the incongruousness of the mixture
of what was original with matter plainly adscititious<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>. Thus
in the Roman edition αδελφων μου των Matt. xxv. 40,
imputed by Tischendorf to B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span> and B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></span>, stands in the margin
just in the same way as ο γαμος Matt. xxii. 10, which he refers
to the first hand. But this is only one instance of a lack of
judgement which deforms every page of their performance:
e.g. Matt. xix. 12; xxiii. 26; 37; xxv. 16; xxvii. 12; 13; 45;
xxviii. 15; Acts xv. 1: all which places exhibit, undistinguished
from emendations of the original scribe or his <span class="tei tei-q">“corrector,”</span> readings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the margin or between the lines which Tischendorf asserts
to belong mostly to B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">3</span></span>, a few to B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length, after baffling delays only too readily accounted
for by the public calamities of the Papal state, the concluding
volume of this sumptuous and important work was published
late in 1881. Sergius had now retired through failing eyesight,
and his place was taken by <span class="tei tei-q">“Henricus Canonicus Fabiani,”</span>
Cozza (who is now Abbot of the Grotta Ferrata at Tusculum
near Frascati, the chief seat of the monks of the Greek order
of St. Basil) still holding the second place. From the laudatory
tone in which the latter is spoken of (p. xiv), it would seem
that the Preface was written by his new colleague, who
acknowledges the help of U. Ubaldi and the Basilian monk
Ant. Rocchi, all three <span class="tei tei-q">“adjutoribus et administris miratis
equidem se tantis viris adjutores et successores datos”</span> (p. xv).
This Preface consists of twenty-two pages, and contains
almost nothing that is interesting to the critic, much that
displays superficial and newly-acquired acquaintance with
the whole subject. Fabiani assigns the end of the fourth
century as the date of the manuscript, regarding it as only
a few years older than the Sinaitic copy<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>, whose discovery he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hails without a vestige of ungenerous jealousy: <span class="tei tei-q">“Quorum tale
est demum par, ut potius liber Vaticanus gaudere debeat quod
tam sui similem invenerit fratrem, quam expavescere quod
aemulum”</span> (p. viii). Since that time a splendid edition has been
issued of the New Testament in 1889, and the Old in 1890,
under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi, in which the whole
is beautifully exhibited in photograph: so that all students
can now examine for themselves the readings and characteristics
of this celebrated manuscript with all but the advantage which
is given in an examination of the original vellum itself (Novum
Testamentum e Codd. Vat. 1209, &amp;c. Rom. 1889, 4to): and
gratitude is due from all textual scholars to the authorities of
the Vatican.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who agree the most unreservedly respecting the age of
the Codex Vaticanus, vary widely in their estimate of its critical
value. By some it has been held in such undue esteem that its
readings, if probable in themselves, and supported (or even
though not supported) by two or three other copies and versions,
have been accepted in preference to the united testimony of all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
authorities besides: while others, admitting the interest due to
age, have spoken of its text as one of the most vicious extant.
Without anticipating what must be discussed hereafter we may
say at once, that, while we accord to Cod. B at least as much
weight as to any single document in existence, we ought never to
forget that it is but one out of many, several of them being nearly
(and one quite) as old, and in other respects not less worthy of
confidence than itself. One marked feature, characteristic of this
copy, is the great number of its omissions, which has induced
Dr. Dobbin to speak of it as presenting <span class="tei tei-q">“an abbreviated text of
the New Testament:”</span> and certainly the facts he states on this
point are startling enough<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>. He calculates that Codex B leaves
out words or whole clauses no less than 330 times in Matthew,
365 in Mark, 439 in Luke, 357 in John, 384 in the Acts, 681
in the surviving Epistles; or 2,556 times in all. That no small
proportion of these are mere oversights of the scribe seems
evident from the circumstance that this same scribe has repeatedly
written words and clauses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice over</span></em>, a class of mistakes which
Mai and the collators have seldom thought fit to notice, inasmuch
as the false addition has not been retraced by the second hand,
but which by no means enhances our estimate of the care
employed in copying this venerable record of primitive Christianity<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a>.
Hug and others have referred the origin of Codex B to
Egypt, but (unlike in this respect to Codex A) its history does
not confirm their conjecture, and the argument derived from
orthography or grammatical forms, is now well understood to
be but slight and ambiguous<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>. Dr. Hort, on no very substantial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grounds, is <span class="tei tei-q">“inclined to surmise that B and א were both written
in the West, probably at Rome”</span> (Introduction, pp. 265-7).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Ephraemi</span></span>, No. 9, in the Royal Library of Paris, is
a most valuable palimpsest containing portions of the Septuagint
version of the Old Testament on sixty-four leaves, and fragments
of every part of the New on 145 leaves, amounting on the whole
to less than two-thirds of the volume<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>. This manuscript seems
to have been brought from the East by Andrew John Lascar
[d. 1535], a learned Greek patronized by Lorenzo de' Medici; it
once belonged to Cardinal Nicolas Ridolphi of that family, was
brought into France by Queen Catherine de' Medici of evil
memory, and so passed into the Royal Library at Paris<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>. The
ancient writing is barely legible, having been almost removed
about the twelfth century to receive some Greek works of
St. Ephraem, the great Syrian Father [299-378]. A chemical
preparation applied at the instance of Fleck in 1834, though it
revived much that was before illegible, has defaced the vellum
with stains of various colours, from green and blue to black and
brown. The older writing was first noticed by Peter Allix
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nearly two centuries ago; various readings extracted from it
were communicated by Boivin to Kuster, who published them
(under the notation of Paris 9) in his edition of Mill's N. T.,
1710. A complete collation of the New Testament was first
made in 1716 by Wetstein, then very young, for Bentley's projected
edition, for which labour (as he records the fact himself)
he paid Wetstein £50. This collation Wetstein of course used
for his own Greek Testament of 1751-2, and though several
persons subsequently examined the manuscript, and so became
aware that more might be gathered from it, it was not until
1843 that Tischendorf brought out at Leipsic his full and noble
edition of the New Testament portion; the Old Testament he
published in 1845. Although Tischendorf complains of the
typographical errors made in his absence in the former of these
two volumes, and has corrected them in the other, they probably
comprise by far the most masterly production of this nature up
to that date published; it is said too that none but those who
have seen Codex C can appreciate the difficulty of deciphering
some parts of it<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>, in fact, whatever is not patent at first sight.
The Prolegomena are especially valuable; the uncial type does
not aim at being an imitation, but the facsimile faithfully
represents the original, even to the present colour of the ink.
In shape Codex C is about the size of Cod. A, but not quite
so tall; its vellum is hardly so fine as that of Cod. A and
a few others, yet sufficiently good. In this copy there is but one
column in a page, which contains from forty to forty-six lines
(usually forty-one), the characters being a little larger than those
of either A or B, and somewhat more elaborate<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a>. Thus the points
at the ends of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sigma</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span>, and especially of the horizontal
line of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tau</span></span> are more decided than in Codex A; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>, though
not so fully formed as in later books, is less simple than in A,
the strokes being of less equal thickness, and the base more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ornamented. On the other hand, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span> are nearer the
model of Codex B. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iota</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">upsilon</span></span>, which in Cod. A and
many other copies have two dots over them when they commence
a syllable, and are sometimes found with one dot, have
here a small straight line in their place (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg036" class="tei tei-ref">36</a>). There are
no breathings or accents by the first hand: the apostrophus is
found but rarely, chiefly with Proper names, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">δαδ᾽</span></span> The uncial
writing is continuous; the punctuation of Cod. C, like that of A
and B, consisting only of a single point, mostly but not always
put level with the top of the preceding letter; wherever such
a point was employed, a space of one letter broad was usually
left vacant: these points are most common in the later books
of the N. T. The κεφάλαια are not placed in the upper margin of
the page as in Cod. A, but a list of their τίτλοι preceded each
Gospel: the so-called Ammonian sections stand in the margin,
but not at present the Eusebian canons; though, since lines of
the text written in vermilion have been thoroughly washed out,
the canons (for which that colour was commonly employed)
may easily have shared the same fate (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg061" class="tei tei-ref">61</a>). There is no
trace of chapters in the Acts, Epistles, or Apocalypse, and both
the titles and subscriptions to the various books are very simple.
Capital letters are used quite as freely as in Cod. A, both at the
commencement of the (Ammonian) sections, and in many other
places. All these circumstances taken together indicate for
Cod. C as early a date as the fifth century, though there is
no sufficient cause for deeming it at all older than Cod. A.
Alexandria has been assigned as its native country, for the very
insufficient reasons stated when we were describing A and B.
It is carefully transcribed, and of its great critical value there is
no doubt; its text seems to stand nearly midway between A and
B, somewhat inclining to the latter. Two correctors have been
very busily at work on Cod. C, greatly to the perplexity of the
critical collator: they are respectively indicated by Tischendorf
as C**, C***. The earliest, or the second hand, may have been
of the sixth century, and his corrections are for some cause
regarded by Dr. Hort as almost equally valuable for critical
purposes with the manuscript itself: the second corrector, or
the third hand, is perhaps of the ninth century, and he
revised such portions as were adapted to ecclesiastical use,
inserting many accents, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rough</span></em> breathing, and some vocal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
notes. By him or more probably by a fourth hand (who did
not change the text, but added some liturgical directions in the
margin) small crosses were interpolated as stops, agreeably to
the fashion of their times.

D <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">of the Gospels and Acts, Codex Bezae Graeco-Latinus</span></span>,
belongs to the University Library at Cambridge, where the open
volume is conspicuously exhibited to visitors in the New
Building (Nn. ii. 41). It was presented to the University in
1581 by Theodore Beza, for whom and his master Calvin the
heads of that learned body then cherished a veneration which
already boded ill for the peace of the English Church<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>. Between
the Gospels (whose order was spoken of above, pp. <a href="#Pg072" class="tei tei-ref">72-4</a>)
and the Acts, the Catholic Epistles once stood, of which only
a few verses remain in the Latin translation (3 John ver. 11-15),
followed by the words <span class="tei tei-q">“epistulae Johannis III explicit, incipit

partially made known by numerous extracts from it, under the
designation of β´ in the margin of Robert Stephen's Greek
Testament of 1550, whose account of it is that it was collated
for him in Italy by his friends (τὸ δὲ β´ ἐστὶ τὸ ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ ὑπὸ τῶν

Beza in his editions of the Greek Testament published in
1582, 1589, and 1598, made some occasional references to the
readings of his manuscript. Archbishop Whitgift borrowed it
from Cambridge in 1583, and caused a poor transcript to be
made of its Greek text, which he bequeathed to Trinity College
(whereof he had been Master), in whose Library it still remains
(B. x. 3).

Patrick Young, of whom we have heard in connexion with
Cod. A (p. <a href="#Pg103" class="tei tei-ref">103</a> and note 1), sent extracts from Cod. D to the
brothers Dupuy at Paris, through whom they reached Morinus
and Steph. Curcellaeus. An unusually full collation was made
for Walton's Polyglott (Tom. vi, Num. xvi, 1657) by pious
Archbishop Ussher, who devoted to these studies the doleful
leisure of his latter years. Mill collated and Wetstein transcribed
(1716) this document for their great editions of the
Greek Testament, but they both did their work carelessly; and
though Bentley was allowed to keep it at home for seven
years, his notices of its readings, as represented by Mr. Ellis
(Bentleii Critica Sacra, pp. 2-26), or preserved in Stephen's
N. T. of 1549 (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 4), were put to no practical
use. The best collation by far was made about 1732 by John
Dickinson of St. John's College for John Jackson of Leicester,
with whose other books it came into Jesus College Library
(O. θ. 2), where it has lain neglected. But a manuscript
replete as this is with variations from the sacred text beyond all
other example could be adequately represented only by being
published in full; a design entrusted by the University of
Cambridge to Dr. Thomas Kipling, Senior Wrangler in 1768
and afterwards Dean of Peterborough [d. 1822], whose <span class="tei tei-q">“Codex
Theodori Bezae Cantabrigiensis”</span> 1793, 2 vols. fol. (in type
imitating the original handwriting much more closely than in
Cod. A and the rest), is a not unfaithful transcript of the text<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though the Prolegomena too plainly testify to the editor's
pitiable ignorance of sacred criticism, while his habit of placing
the readings of the several later hands (very loosely distinguished
from each other) in the text, and those of the first
hand in the notes (a defect we have also noted in the Roman
editions of Cod. B), renders his volumes very inconvenient for
use. Let Kipling be praised for the care and exact diligence
his work evinces, but Herbert Marsh [1757-1839] was of all
Cambridge men of that period the only one known to be competent
for such a task. In 1864 the present writer was aided
by the Syndics of the Cambridge Press in publishing an edition
of Codex Bezae in common type, illustrated by a copious Introduction
and critical notes, to which work the reader is referred
for fuller information respecting this manuscript.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Codex Bezae is a quarto volume 10 inches high by
8 broad, with one column on a page, the Greek text and its
Latin version being parallel, the Greek on the left, or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">verso</span></span> of
each leaf, and the Latin on the right, opposite to it, on the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">recto</span></span>
of the next. Notwithstanding the Alexandrian forms that
abound in it as much as in any other copy, and which have
been held by some to prove the Egyptian origin of Codd. ABC,
the fact of its having a Latin version sufficiently attests its
Western origin. The vellum is not quite equal in fineness
to that of a few others. There are thirty-three lines in every
page, and these of unequal length, as this manuscript is arranged
in στίχοι, being the earliest in date that is so (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg053" class="tei tei-ref">53</a>). The
Latin is placed in the same line and as nearly as possible in the
same order as the corresponding Greek. It has not the larger
κεφάλαια or Eusebian canons, but only the so-called Ammonian
sections, often incorrectly placed, and obviously in a later hand
of about the ninth century. The original absence of these divisions
is no proof that the book was not at first intended for
ecclesiastical use (as some have stated), inasmuch as the sections
and canons were constructed for a very different purpose (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see
above</span></span>, pp. <a href="#Pg059" class="tei tei-ref">59-63</a>), but is another argument for its being copied
in the West, perhaps not far from the place where it rested so
long. Other proofs of its Occidental, perhaps of its Gallican origin,
especially that derived from the style of the Latin version, are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
collected in Scrivener's edition (Introd. pp. xxxi, xl-xlv). The
characters are of the same size as in C, larger on the whole than
in AB, but betray a later age than any of these, although the
Latin as well as the Greek is written continuously, excepting
that in the titles and subscriptions of the several books (as in
Codd. DH of St. Paul) the words are separated. This copy has
paragraph divisions of unequal length peculiar to itself<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>. They
are indicated by placing the initial letter out in the margin,
that letter being usually of the same size with the rest, though
sometimes a little larger. Cod. D appears to be the earliest
which exhibits larger letters after a pause in the middle of
a line; but these are not very frequent. Instances of each
case may be noticed in our facsimile (No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>), wherein the shapes
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kappa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rho</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phi</span></span>, as indicated before (pp. <a href="#Pg032" class="tei tei-ref">32</a>, note 1, <a href="#Pg037" class="tei tei-ref">37</a>,
<a href="#Pg039" class="tei tei-ref">39</a>), are very observable. The Greek and Latin writing on the
opposite pages are much like each other in appearance, the Latin
letters being round and flowing, not square as in codices a little
earlier in date, such as the Medicean and Vatican fragments of
Virgil. This manuscript has been corrected, first by the original
penman with a light stroke made by a pen nearly empty; after
him by not less than eight or nine different revisers, some nearly
coeval with the Codex itself, others not many centuries old.
The changes they have made, especially when they employed
a knife to scrape away the primitive reading, render too many
places almost illegible. The first scribe often used a sponge to
wash out his error before the ink was well dried in (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg027" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>).
In addition to the single point about three-fourths of the height
of a letter up, which often subdivides the στίχοι in both languages
(facsimile, No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>, l. 9) the coarse late hand which inserted the
Ammonian sections placed double dots (:) after the numerals, and
often inserted similar points in the text, before or over the first
letter of a section. Each member of the genealogy in Luke iii
forms a separate στίχος, as in Cod. B: quotations are indicated
by throwing the commencement of the lines which contain
them, both Greek and Latin, about an inch back or less
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(e.g. Matt. xxvi. 31; Mark i. 2, 3; Acts ii. 34, 35; iv. 25,
26). The first three lines of each book, in both languages,
were written in bright red ink, which was also employed in
the alternate lines of the subscriptions, and in other slight
ornaments. The traces of the scribe's needle and lines (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
p. <a href="#Pg027" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>) are very visible, the margin ample, and the volume on
the whole in good keeping, though its first extant page (Latin)
is much decayed, and it is stained in parts by some chemical
mixture that has been applied to it. The portions supplied by
a later hand are of course in the uncial Greek and cursive Latin
characters usual at the dates assigned to them. The liturgical
notes in the margin of the Saturday and Sunday lessons
(ανναγνοσμα is the form often used) are in thick letters, of a yet
later date than the Ammonian sections. A few others for the
great Feasts and Fast days occur; and, in a hand of about
the twelfth century, lessons for the Festivals of St. George and
St. Dionysius, the patron saints of England and France, as
may be seen in the table of Menology.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The vellum employed for Codex Bezae is arranged in quires of
four sheets (or eight leaves) each even throughout<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>, the numeral
signatures of which are set <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span> so low down in the
margin at the foot of the last page of each, that they are mostly
cut off, in whole or partly, by the binder. Assuming that
it ended with the Acts of the Apostles, it originally consisted
of upwards of sixty-four (probably of sixty-seven) quires, of
which the first, forty-fourth, and sixty-fourth, have each lost
some leaves, the thirty-fourth is entire though containing but
six leaves, while those signed Γ (3), ΙΔ (14), ΚΒ (22), ΜΕ (45),
down to ΝΒ (52), ΝΖ (57), and all after ΞΔ (64), are wholly
wanting. The result is that out of the 534 leaves it originally
contained, only 406 now survive, about twelve of them being
more or less mutilated. It is not easy to surmise what may
have been written on the sixty-seven leaves that intervened
between ΜΔ 5 and ΝΓ 1; the gap ends with 3 John ver. 11
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(Greek), but the space is apparently too great for the Catholic
Epistles alone, even though we suppose that Jude was inserted
(as appears in some catalogues) otherwise than in the last
place. The leaves added by later hands are nine in number.
The Greek portion of the supplement to St. John (xviii. 14-xx.
13) much resembles in text the style of the original manuscript,
and is often supported by Codd. אAB(C). The Latin of this
portion is taken from the Vulgate version.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The internal character of the Codex Bezae is a most difficult
and indeed an almost inexhaustible theme. No known manuscript
contains so many bold and extensive interpolations (six
hundred, it is said, in the Acts alone), countenanced, where they
are not absolutely unsupported, chiefly by the Old Latin and the
Curetonian version: its own parallel Latin translation is too
servilely accommodated to the Greek text to be regarded as an
independent authority, save where the corresponding Greek
is lost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This passage was penned by Dr. Scrivener before the publication
of the highly ingenious treatise by Mr. Rendel Harris,
entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“A Study of the Codex Bezae”</span> (1891), being the beginning
of the second volume of the Cambridge <span class="tei tei-q">“Texts and Studies.”</span>
Mr. Harris from curious internal evidence, such as the existence
in the text of a vitiated rendering of a verse of Homer which
bears signs of having been retranslated from a Latin translation,
infers that the Greek has been made up from the Latin, and
traces the latter to the second century. He shows its affinity
with the text of Irenaeus, and discovers traces in it of Montanism.
He opens up many points of interest for any one who would
examine this <span class="tei tei-q">“singular Codex”</span>: but injustice must not be done
to the fertile author by supposing that in what is evidently
'a Study' he concludes that he has settled all the numerous
questions which he broaches. No one however can really
investigate the Codex Bezae without studying this work, which
will be found both instructive in the highest degree and
amusing.

Of the manuscripts hitherto described, Codd. אABC for their
presumed critical value, Cod. D for its numberless and strange
deviations from other authorities, and all five for their high
antiquity, demanded a full description. Of those which follow
many contain but a few fragments of the Gospels, and others
are so recent in date that they hardly exceed in importance
some of the best cursive copies (e.g. FGHS)<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>. None of these
need detain us long.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
E. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Basiliensis</span></span> (B vi. 21, now A. N. iii. 12) (κεφ. τ.,
κεφ., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Am., Eus.</span></span> at foot of the pages) contains the four Gospels,
excepting Luke iii. 4-15; xxiv. 47-53, and was written about
the middle of the eighth century, unless (with Dean Burgon) we
refer it to the seventh. It measures 9 x 6-½ inches, and contains
318 folios. There are 247 folios <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">verso</span></span>, and 71 <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">recto</span></span><a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>. Three leaves
(160, 207, 214) on which are Luke i. 69-ii. 4; xii. 58-xiii. 12;
xv. 8-20 are in a cursive and later hand, above the obliterated
fragments of a homily as old as the main body of the manuscript.
There is a <span class="tei tei-q">“liber praedicatorum”</span> on the first folio. This
copy is one of the most notable of the later uncials, and might
well have been published at length. It was given to a religious
house in Basle by Cardinal John de Ragusio, who was sent on a
mission to the Greeks by the Council of Basle (1431), and probably
brought it from Constantinople. Erasmus much overlooked it
for later books when preparing his Greek Testament at Basle;
indeed it was not brought into the Public Library there before
1559. A collation was sent to Mill by John Battier, Greek
Professor at Basle: Mill named it B. I, and truly declared it to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be <span class="tei tei-q">“probatae fidei et bonae notae.”</span> Bengal (who obtained a few
extracts from it) calls it Basil. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>: but its first real collator was
Wetstein, whose native town it adorns. Since his time, Tischendorf
in 1843, Professor Müller of Basle and Tregelles in
1846, have independently collated it throughout. Judging
from the specimen sent to him, Mill (N. T. Proleg. § 1118)
thought the hand much like that of Cod. A; the uncial letters
(though not so regular or neat) are firm, round, and simple:
indeed <span class="tei tei-q">“the penmanship is exceedingly tasteful and delicate
throughout. The employment of green, blue, and vermilion in
the capitals I do not remember to have met with elsewhere”</span>
(Burgon, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span>, Jan. 29, 1873). There is but one column of
about twenty-four lines on the page; it has breathings and accents
pretty uniformly, and not ill placed; otherwise, from the shape of
most of the letters (e.g. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>, facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_XI" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>, lines 1, 3), it might
be judged of earlier date: observe, however, the oblong form
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omicron</span></span> where the space is crowded in the last line of
the facsimile, when the older scribes would have retained
the circular shape and made the letter very small (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_IV" class="tei tei-ref">11</a> b. l. 6): <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span> also and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">xi</span></span> betray a less ancient
scribe. The single stop in Cod. E, as was stated above (p. <a href="#Pg048" class="tei tei-ref">48</a>),
changes its place according to the variation of its power, as in
other copies of about the same age. The capitals at the beginning
of sections stand out in the margin as in Codd. AC.
The lists of the larger κεφάλαια together with the numbers of
the sections in the margin and the Eusebian canons beneath
them, as well as harmonizing references to the other Gospels at
the foot of the page, names of Feast days with their Proper
lessons, and other liturgical notices, have been inserted (as some
think, but erroneously in Burgon's judgement) by a later hand.
Under the text (Mark i. 5, 6) are placed the harmonizing references,
in the order (varying in each Gospel) Mark, Luke, John,
Matthew. Ι<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ω</span></span> (John) furnishes no parallel on this page. The
first section (α) of Μ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ρ</span></span> (Mark i. 1, 2) corresponds to the seventieth
(ο) of Λ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ο</span></span> (Luke vii. 27), and to the 103rd (ργ) of M (Matt. xi.
10). Again the second (β) of Mark (i. 3) is parallel to the seventh
(ζ) of Luke (iii. 3), and to the eighth (η) of Matt. (iii. 3). The
passage given in our facsimile (No. <a href="#Plate_XI" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>) is part of the third (γ) of
Mark (i. 4-6), and answers to nothing in Luke, but to the ninth
(θ) of Matt. (iii. 4-6). See p. <a href="#Pg060" class="tei tei-ref">60</a>, note 4. The value of this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
codex, as supplying materials for criticism, is considerable. It
approaches more nearly than some others of its date to the text
now commonly received, and is an excellent witness for it. The
asterisk is much used to indicate disputed passages: e.g. Matt.
xvi. 2, 3: Luke xxii. 43, 44; xxiii. 34: John viii. 2-11. (For
the fragments attached to this Codex, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Apoc. 15.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
F. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Boreeli</span></span>, now in the Public Library at Utrecht,
once belonged to John Boreel [d. 1629], Dutch ambassador at
the court of King James I. Wetstein obtained some readings
from it in 1730, as far as Luke xi, but stated that he knew not
where it then was. In 1830 Professor Heringa of Utrecht discovered
it in private hands at Arnheim, and procured it for his
University Library, where in 1850 Tregelles found it, though
with some difficulty, the leaves being torn and all loose in a box,
and he then made a facsimile; Tischendorf had looked through
it in 1841. In 1843, after Heringa's death, H. E. Vinke published
that scholar's <span class="tei tei-q">“Disputatio de Codice Boreeliano,”</span> which
includes a full and exact collation of the text. Cod. F contains
the Four Gospels with many defects, some of which have been
caused since the collation was made which Wetstein published:
hence the codex must still sometimes be cited on his authority
as F<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">w</span></span>. In fact there are but 204 leaves and a few fragments
remaining, written with two columns of about nineteen lines each
on the page, in a tall, oblong, upright form; it was referred by
Mr. H. Deane in 1876 to the eighth, by Tischendorf to the
ninth, by Tregelles to the tenth century. In St. Luke there
are no less than twenty-four gaps: in Wetstein's collation it
began at Matt. vii. 6, but now at Matt. ix. 1. Other hiatus
are Matt. xii. 1-44; xiii. 55-xiv. 9; xv. 20-31; xx. 18-xxi.
5: Mark i. 43-ii. 8; ii. 23-iii. 5; xi. 6-26; xiv. 54-xv. 5;

vii. 28-viii. 10; x. 32-xi. 3; xi. 40-xii. 3; xii. 14-25:
it ends at John xiii. 34. Few manuscripts have fallen into
such unworthy hands. The Eusebian canons are wanting, the
sections standing without them in the margin. Thus in Mark
x. 13 (see facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_XI" class="tei tei-ref">28</a>) the section ρϛ (106) has not under
it the proper canon β (2). The letters <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epsilon</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span>,

(B. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">xvii.</span></span> 20) Tregelles found the fragments in 1845 (Account of
the Printed Text, p. 160). Subsequently Cod. G came with the
rest of the Harleian collection into the British Museum; Cod.
H, which had long been missing, was brought to light in the
Public Library of Hamburg, through Petersen the Librarian,
in 1838. Codd. GH have now been thoroughly collated both
by Tischendorf and Tregelles. Cod. G appears to be of the
tenth, Cod. H of the ninth century, and is stated to be of higher
critical value. Besides the mutilated fragments at Trinity
College (Matt. v. 29-31; 39-43 of Cod. G; Luke i. 3-6; 13-15
of Cod. H), many parts of both have perished: viz. in Cod.
G 372 verses; Matt. i. 1-vi. 6; vii. 25-viii. 9; viii. 23-ix.
2; xxviii. 18-Mark i. 13; xiv. 19-25: Luke i. 1-13; v. 4-vii.
3; viii. 46-ix. 5; xii. 27-41; xxiv. 41-53: John xviii.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
5-19; xix. 4-27 (of which one later hand supplies Matt, xxviii.
18-Mark i. 8: John xviii. 5-19; another Luke xii. 27-41):
in Cod. H 679 verses; Matt. i. 1-xv. 30; xxv. 33-xxvi. 3;
Mark i. 32-ii. 4; xv. 44-xvi. 14; Luke v. 18-32; vi. 8-22;
x. 2-19: John ix. 30-x. 25; xviii. 2-18; xx. 12-25. Cod. G
has some Church notes in the margin; Cod. H the sections
without the Eusebian canons; G however has both sections
and canons; its τίτλοι and larger κεφάλαια are in red (those of
St. John being lost), and the Church notes seem <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>.
Each member of the genealogy in Luke iii forms a separate line.
Both G and H are written in a somewhat rude style, with
breathings and accents rather irregularly placed, as was the fashion
of their times; G in two columns of twenty-two lines each on
a page, H in one column of twenty-three lines. In each the latest
form of the uncial letters is very manifest (e.g. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span>), but G
is the neater of the two. In G the single point, in H a kind of
Maltese cross, are the prevailing marks of punctuation. Our
facsimiles (Nos. <a href="#Plate_XI" class="tei tei-ref">29</a> of G, <a href="#Plate_XII" class="tei tei-ref">31</a> of H) are due to Tregelles; that of
G he took from the fragment at Trinity College. Inasmuch as
beside Matt. v. 30, 31 in Cod. G ΑΡ [with a χ between and above them] (ἀρχή) is conspicuous in
the margin, and ΤΕ Τ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Η</span></span>Σ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Λε</span></span> (τέλος τῆς λέξεως) stands in the text
itself, good scholars may be excused for having mistaken it for
a scrap of some Evangelistarium.

I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Tischendorfian.</span></span> II at St. Petersburg, consists of
palimpsest fragments found by Tischendorf in 1853 <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
dust of an Eastern library,”</span> i.e. in the Convent of St. Saba near
the Red Sea, and published in his new series of <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra
inedita,”</span> vol. i, 1855. On the twenty-eight vellum leaves (eight of
them on four double leaves) Georgian writing covers the partially
obliterated Greek, which is for the most part very hard to read.
They compose portions of no less than seven different manuscripts;
the first two, of the fifth century, are as old as Codd.
AC (the first having scarcely any capital letters and those
very slightly larger than the rest); the third fragment seems of
the sixth century, nearly of the date of Cod. N (p. <a href="#Pg139" class="tei tei-ref">139</a>), about
as old as Cod. P (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg143" class="tei tei-ref">143</a>); the fourth scarcely less ancient:
all four, like other palimpsests, have the pseudo-Ammonian
sections without the Eusebian canons (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg061" class="tei tei-ref">61</a>).  Of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

10-19. The fifth fragment (I<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">e</span></span>), containing portions of the Acts
and of St. Paul's Epistles (1 Cor. xv. 53-xvi. 9; Tit. i. 1-13;
Acts xxviii. 8-17) is as old as the third, if not as the first. The
sixth and seventh fragments are of the seventh century: viz.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frag.</span></span> 6 or I<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">f</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of two leaves</span></span>) Acts ii. 6-17; xxvi. 7-18: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frag.</span></span> 7
or I<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: sub">g</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of one leaf</span></em>) Acts xiii. 39-46. In all seven are 255 verses.
All except <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frag.</span></span> 6 are in two columns of from twenty-nine to
eighteen lines each, and unaccentuated; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frag.</span></span> 6 has but one
column on a page, with some accents. The first five fragments, so
far as they extend, must be placed in the highest rank as critical
authorities. The first, as cited in Tischendorf's eighth edition of
his Greek Testament, agrees with Cod. A thirty-four times, four
times with Cod. B, and twenty-three times with the two united;
it stands alone eleven times. The text of the second and third is
more mixed though they incline more to favour Codd. אB; not,
however, so decidedly as the first does Cod. A. Tischendorf gives
us six facsimiles of them in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita,”</span>. Nova
Collect. vol. i (1885), a seventh in <span class="tei tei-q">“Anecdota sacra et profana,”</span> 1855.
From the same Armenian book, as Tischendorf thinks (and he
was very likely to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>), are taken the three palimpsest leaves
of 2 and 3 Kings, and the six of Isaiah published by him in
the same volume of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta.”</span>

K. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Cyprius</span></span>, or No. 63 of the Royal Library at
Paris, shares only with Codd. אBMSU the advantage of being
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em> uncial copy of the Four Gospels. It was brought
into the Colbert Library from Cyprus in 1673; Mill inserted
its readings from Simon; it was re-examined by Scholz,
whose inaccuracies (especially those committed when collating
Cod. K for his <span class="tei tei-q">“Curae Criticae in Historiam textûs Evangeliorum,”</span>
Heidelberg, 1820) have been strongly denounced by later editors,
and it must be feared with too good reason. The independent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
collations of Tischendorf and Tregelles have now done all
that can be needed for this copy. It is an oblong quarto, in
compressed uncials, of about the middle of the ninth century
at the latest, having one column of about twenty-one lines on
each page, but the handwriting is irregular and varies much in
size. A single point being often found where the sense does
not require it, this codex has been thought to have been copied
from an older one arranged in στίχοι; the ends of each στίχος
may have been indicated in this manner by the scribe. The
subscriptions, τίτλοι, the sections, and indices of the κεφάλαια
of the last three Gospels are believed to be the work of a later
hand: the Eusebian canons are absent. The breathings and
accents are <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>, but often omitted or incorrectly
placed. Itacisms and permutations of consonants are very
frequent, and the text is of an unusual and interesting character.
Scholz regards the directions for the Church lessons,
even the ἀρχαί and τέλη in the margin at the beginning and
end of lessons, as by the original scribe. He transcribes at
length the ἐκλογάδιον τῶν δ᾽ εὐαγγελιστῶν and the fragments of
a menology prefixed to Cod. K (N. T. vol. i, pp. 455-493),
of which tables it affords the earliest specimen. The second
hand writes at the end προσδέξηται αὐτὴν [τὴν δέλτον] ἡ παναγία
θεοτόκος καὶ ὁ ἅγιος εὐτύχιος. The style of this copy will be
seen from our facsimile (No. <a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref">19</a>) taken from John vi. 52, 53:
the number of the section (ξϛ´) or 66 stands in the margin,
but the ordinary place of the Eusebian canon (ι or 10) under
it is filled by a simple flourish. The stop in 1. 1 after λεγοντεσ
illustrates the unusual punctuation of this copy, as may that
after ὁ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ισ</span></span> in 1. 3.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
L. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Regius</span></span>, No. 62 in the Royal Library at Paris, is
by far the most remarkable document of its age and class. It
contains the Four Gospels, except the following passages,
Matt. iv. 22-v. 14; xxviii. 17-20: Mark x. 16-30; xv. 2-20:
John xxi. 15-25. It was written in about the eighth century
and consists of 257 leaves quarto, of thick vellum, 9 inches high
by 6-½ broad, with two columns of twenty-five lines each on a page,
regularly marked, as we so often see, by the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">stilus</span></span> and ruler (p. 27).
This is doubtless Stephen's η´, though he cites it erroneously in
Acts xxiv. 7 bis; xxv. 14; xxvii. 1; xxviii. 11: it was even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then in the Royal Library, although <span class="tei tei-q">“Roberto Stephano”</span> is
marked in the volume. Wetstein collated Cod. L but loosely;
Griesbach, who set a very high value on it, studied it with
peculiar care; Tischendorf published it in full in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta
sacra inedita,”</span> 1846. It is but carelessly written, and abounds
with errors of the ignorant scribe, who was more probably an
Egyptian than a native Greek. The breathings and accents are
often deficient, often added wrongly, and placed throughout
without rule or propriety. The apostrophus also is common, and
frequently out of place; the points for stops are quite irregular,
as we have elsewhere stated (p. <a href="#Pg048" class="tei tei-ref">48</a>). Capitals occur plentifully,
often painted and in questionable taste (see facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_IX" class="tei tei-ref">21</a>,
column 2), and there is a tendency throughout to inelegant
ornament. This codex is in bad condition through damp, the
ink brown or pale, the uncial letters of a debased oblong
shape: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phi</span></span> is enormously large and sometimes quite angular;
other letters are such as might be looked for from its date, and
are neither neat nor remarkably clear. The lessons for Sundays,
festivals, &amp;c. and the ἀρχαί and τέλη are marked everywhere in
the margin, especially in St. Matthew; there are also many
corrections and important critical notes (e.g. Mark xvi. 8) in the
text or margin, apparently <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>. Our facsimile is taken
from a photograph of its most important page, Mark xvi. 8, 9,
with part of the note cited at length below. Before each Gospel
are indices of the κεφάλαια, now imperfect: we find also the τίτλοι
at the head and occasionally at the foot of the several pages; the
numbers of the κεφάλαια (usually pointed out by the sign of the
cross), the sections and Eusebian canons stand in the inner
margin<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> often ill put, as if only half understood. The critical
weight of this copy may best be discussed hereafter; it will
here suffice barely to mention its strong resemblance to Cod. B
(less, however, in St. John's Gospel than elsewhere), to the
citations of Origen [186-253], and to the margin of the Harkleian
Syriac version [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 616]. Cod. L abounds in what are
termed Alexandrian forms, beyond any other copy of its date.

M. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Campianus</span></span>, No. 48 in the Royal Library at Paris,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contains the Four Gospels complete in a small quarto form, written
in very elegant and minute uncials of the end of the ninth
century, with two columns of twenty-four lines each on a page.
The Abbé François de Camps gave it to Louis XIV, Jan. 1,
1707. This document is Kuster's 2 (1710); it was collated by
Wetstein, Scholz, and Tregelles; transcribed in 1841 by Tischendorf.
Its synaxarion and menology have been published by
Scholz in the same place as those of Cod. K, and obviously
with great carelessness. Ἀναγνώσματα, i.e. notes of the Church
Lessons, abound in the margin (Tischendorf thinks them <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ
manu</span></span>) in a very small hand, like in style to the Oxford Plato
(Clarke 39, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg042" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>). We find too Hippolytus' Chronology
of the Gospels, Eusebius' letter to Carpianus with his canons,
and some Arabic scrawl on the last leaf, of which the name
of Jerusalem alone has been read, a note in Slavonic, and
others in a contemporaneous cursive hand. Dean Burgon also
observed at the foot of the several pages the same kind of
harmony as we described for Cod. E. It has breathings, accents
pretty fairly given, and a musical notation in red, so frequent in
Church manuscripts of the age. Its readings are very good;
itacisms and ν ἐφελκυστικόν are frequent. Tischendorf compares
the form of its uncials to those of Cod. V; which, judging from
the facsimile given by Matthaei, we should deem somewhat
less beautiful. From our facsimile (No. <a href="#Plate_XII" class="tei tei-ref">32</a>) it will be seen that
the round letters are much narrowed, the later form of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span> quite decided, while <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span> might look earlier.
Our specimen (John vii. 53-viii. 2) represents the celebrated
Pericope adulterae in one of its earliest forms.

N. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Purpureus.</span></span> Only twelve leaves of this beautiful
copy were till recently believed to survive, and some former
possessor must have divided them in order to obtain a better
price from several purchasers than from one. Four leaves are
now in the British Museum (Cotton, Titus C. xv), six in the
Vatican (No. 3785), two at Vienna (Lambec. 2), at the end of
a fragment of Genesis in a different hand. The London fragments
(Matt. xxvi. 57-65; xxvii. 26-34: John xiv. 2-10; xv.
15-22) were collated by Wetstein on his first visit to England in
1715, and marked in his Greek Testament by the letter J:
Scrivener transcribed them in 1845, and announced that they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contained fifty-seven various readings, of which Wetstein had
given but five. The Vienna fragment (Luke xxiv. 13-21; 39-49)
had long been known by the descriptions of Lambecius: Wetstein
had called it N; Treschow in 1773 and Alter in 1787 had given
imperfect collations of it. Scholz first noticed the Vatican leaves
(Matt. xix. 6-13; xx. 6-22; xx. 29-xxi. 19), denoted them by Γ,
and used some readings extracted by Gaetano Marini. It was
reserved for Tischendorf (Monumenta sacra inedita, 1846) to
publish them all in full, and to determine by actual inspection
that they were portions of the same manuscript, of the date of
about the end of the sixth century. Besides these twelve leaves
John Sakkelion the Librarian saw in or about 1864 at the
Monastery of St. John in Patmos thirty-three other leaves containing
portions of St. Mark's Gospel (ch. vi. 53-xv. 23)<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a>, whose
readings were communicated to Tischendorf, and are included in
his eighth edition of the N. T. The others were probably stolen
from the same place. This book is written on the thinnest
vellum (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> pp. <a href="#Pg023" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>, <a href="#Pg025" class="tei tei-ref">25</a>), dyed purple, and the silver letters (which
have turned quite black) were impressed in some way upon it,
but are too varied in shape, and at the end of the lines in size,
to admit the supposition of moveable type being used, as some
have thought to be the case in the Codex Argenteus of the Gothic
Gospels. The abridgements <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΧΣ</span></span>, &amp;c. are in gold; and some
changes have been made by an ancient second hand. The so-called
Ammonian sections and the Eusebian canons are faithfully given
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg059" class="tei tei-ref">59</a>), and the Vatican portion has the forty-first, forty-sixth,
and forty-seventh τίτλοι of St. Matthew at the head of the pages.
Each page has two columns of sixteen lines, and the letters
(about ten or twelve in a line) are firm, uniform, bold, and
unornamented, though not quite so much so as in a few older
documents; their lower extremities are bevelled. Their size is
at least four times that of the letters in Cod. A, the punctuation
quite as simple, being a single point (and that usually neglected)
level with the top of the letter (see our facsimile, Plate <a href="#Plate_V" class="tei tei-ref">v</a>, No. 14,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
l. 3), and there is no space left between words even after stops.
A few letters stand out as capitals at the beginning of lines; of
the breathings and accents, if such they be, we have spoken
above (p. <a href="#Pg047" class="tei tei-ref">47</a>). Letters diminished at the end of a line do not
lose their ancient shape, as in many later books: <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">compendia
scribendi</span></span> are rare, yet [symbol] stands for Ν at the end of a line no
less than twenty-nine times in the London leaves alone, but [symbol] for
αι only once. Ι at the beginning of a syllable has two dots over
it, Υ but one. We have discussed above (pp. <a href="#Pg032" class="tei tei-ref">32-39</a>) the shape of
the alphabet in Ν (for by that single letter Tischendorf denotes
it), and compared it with others of nearly the same date; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omega</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lambda</span></span> look more ancient than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">xi</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Plate <a href="#Plate_II" class="tei tei-ref">ii</a>.
No. 4). It exhibits strong Alexandrian forms, e.g. παραλήμψομε,
ειχοσαν (the latter condemned <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">secundâ manu</span></span>), and not a few
such itacisms as the changes of ι and ει, αι and ε.

These Tischendorf (and Tregelles about the same time) deciphered
with great difficulty, as every one who has examined the manuscript
would anticipate, and published in the second volume of
his new collection of <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita.”</span> Each page
contained two columns. We meet with the sections without

capital letters (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg051" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>, note 2), and only the simplest kind of
punctuation, although one rough breathing is legible. Tischendorf
hesitates whether he shall assign the fragment to the fourth
or fifth century. It agrees with Cod. A five or six times, with
Cod. B five, with the two together six, and is against them both
thrice.

These are two palimpsests discovered by F. A.
Knittel, Archdeacon of Wolfenbüttel, in the Ducal Library of
that city, which (together with some fragments of Ulphilas'
Gothic version) lie under the more modern writings of Isidore
of Seville. He published the whole in 1762<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>, so far at least as
he could read them, though Tregelles believed more might be
deciphered, and Tischendorf, with his unconquerable energy,
collating them both in 1854, was able to re-edit them more
accurately, Cod. Q in the third volume (1860) and Cod. P in
the sixth (1869) of his Monumenta sacra inedita. The volume
(called the Codex Carolinus) seems to have been once at Bobbio,
and has been traced from Weissenburg to Mayence and Prague,
till it was bought by a Duke of Brunswick in 1689. Codex P
contains, on forty-three or forty-four leaves, thirty-one fragments
of 518 verses, taken from all the four Evangelists<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a>; Codex Q,

few portions, once written in vermilion, have quite departed,
but Tischendorf has made material additions to Knittel's labours,
both in extent and accuracy. He assigns P to the sixth, Q to
the fifth century. Both are written in two columns, the
uncials being bold, round or square, those of Q not a little
the smaller. The letters in P, however, are sometimes compressed
at the end of a line. The capitals in P are large and
frequent, and both have the sections without the canons of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eusebius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg059" class="tei tei-ref">59</a>). The table of τίτλοι found in the volume
is written in oblong uncials of a lower date, as Knittel thought,
possibly without good reason. Itacisms, what are termed Alexandrian
forms, and the usual contractions (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΙΣ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΞΣ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΚΣ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ΘΣ</span></span>,

beautiful facsimiles of Codd. PQ we observe that while

is the case with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epsilon</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sigma</span></span> in P have strong

first hundred verses of St. Luke which are contained in both
copies, wherein P is cited for various readings 216 times,
and Q 182 times, P stands alone fourteen times, Q not once.
P agrees with other manuscripts against AB twenty-one
times, Q nineteen: P agrees with AB united fifty times, Q also
fifty: P sides with B against A twenty-nine times, Q thirty-eight:
but P accords with A against B in 102 places, Q in
seventy-five.

R. This letter, like some that precede, has been used to
represent different books by various editors, a practice the inconvenience
of which is very manifest. (1) R of Griesbach and
Scholz is a fragment of one quarto leaf containing John i. 38-50,
at Tübingen, with musical notes, which from its thick vellum, from
the want of the sections and Eusebian canons, and the general
resemblance of its uncials to those of late Service Books,
Tischendorf pronounces to be an Evangelistarium, and puts in its
room (2) in his N. T. of 1849, fourteen leaves of a palimpsest in the
Royal Library of Naples (Borbon. ii. C. 15) of the eighth century,
under a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Typicum</span></span> (see Suicer, Thes. Eccles. tom. ii. p. 1335), or
Ritual of the Greek Church, of the fourteenth century. These
are fragments from the first three Evangelists, in oblong uncials,
leaning to the right. Tischendorf, by chemical applications, was
able in 1843 to read one page, in two columns of twenty-five lines
each (Mark xiv. 32-39)<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a>, and saw the sections in the margin; the
Eusebian canons he thinks have been washed out (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg059" class="tei tei-ref">59</a>): but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

under the black, broad Syriac writing, being a treatise of
Severus of Antioch against Johannes Grammaticus, of the
eighth or ninth century. There are two columns of about
twenty-five lines each on a page; for their boldness and simplicity
the letters may be referred to the end of the sixth
century; we have given a facsimile of the manuscript (which
cannot be read in parts but with the utmost difficulty), and
an alphabet collected from it (Nos. <a href="#Plate_II" class="tei tei-ref">5</a>, <a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref">17</a>). In size and shape
the letters are much like those of Codd. INP, only that they are
somewhat irregular and straggling: the punctuation is effected
by a single point almost level with the top of the letters, as
in Cod. N. The pseudo-Ammonian sections are there without
the Eusebian canons, and the first two leaves are devoted to the
τίτλοι of St. Luke. This most important palimpsest is one of
the 550 manuscripts brought to England, about 1847, from the
Syrian convent of S. Mary Deipara, in the Nitrian Desert, seventy
miles N. W. of Cairo. When examined at the British Museum
by the late Canon Cureton, then one of the Librarians, he
discovered in the same volume, and published in 1851 (with six
pages in facsimile), a palimpsest of 4000 lines of Homer's Iliad
not in the same hand as St. Luke, but quite as ancient. The
fragments of St. Luke were independently transcribed, with most
laudable patience, both by Tregelles in 1854, and by Tischendorf
in 1855, who afterwards re-examined the places wherein he
differed from Tregelles (e.g. chh. viii. 5; xviii. 7, 10), and discovered
by the aid of Dr. Wright a few more fragments of chh.
vi-viii. Tischendorf published an edition of Cod. R in his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita,”</span> vol. ii, with a facsimile: the amended
readings, together with the newly-discovered variations in chh.
vi. 31-36, 39, vii. 44, 46, 47, are inserted in the eighth edition of
his Greek Testament. In this palimpsest as at present bound
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up in the Museum the fragments of St. Luke end on f. 48,
and the rest of the Greek in the volume is in later, smaller,
sloping uncials, and contains propositions from the tenth and
thirteenth books of Euclid. On the critical character of the
readings of this precious fragment we shall make some comments
below.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
S. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Vaticanus</span></span> 354 contains the four Gospels entire,
and is amongst the earliest dated manuscripts of the Greek
Testament (p. <a href="#Pg041" class="tei tei-ref">41</a>, note 2). This is a folio of 234 leaves, written in
large oblong or compressed uncials: the Epistle to Carpianus
and Eusebian canons are prefixed, and it contains many later
corrections (e.g. Luke viii. 15) and marginal notes (e.g. Matt.
xxvii. 16, 17). Luke xxii. 43, 44; John v. 4; vii. 53-viii. 11 are
obelized. At the end we read ἐγράφει ἡ τιμία δέλτος αὕτη διὰ

(1781-3) seldom noticed orthographical forms or stated where
the readings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agree</span></em> with the received text, so that a more
thorough examination was still required. Tregelles only inspected
it, but Tischendorf, when at Rome in 1866, carefully
re-examined it, and has inserted many of its readings in his
eighth edition and its supplementary leaves. He states that
Birch's facsimile (consisting of the obelized John v. 4) is
coarsely executed, while Bianchini's is too elegant; he made
another for himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
T. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Borgianus</span></span> I, now in the Propaganda at Rome (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see
below</span></span>, <a href="#manuscript-evan-180" class="tei tei-ref">Evan. 180</a>), contains thirteen or more quarto leaves
of SS. Luke and John, with a Thebaic or Sahidic version
at their side, but on the opposite and left page. Each page
consists of two columns: a single point indicates a break in the
sense, but there are no other divisions. The fragment contains
Luke xxii. 20-xxiii. 20; John vi. 28-67; vii. 6-viii. 31 (179
verses, since John vii. 53-viii. 11 are wanting). The portion
containing St. John, both in Greek and Egyptian, was carefully
edited at Rome in 1789 by A. A. Giorgi, an Augustinian
Eremite; his facsimile, however (ch. vii. 35), seems somewhat
rough, though Tischendorf (who has inspected the codex) says
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that its uncials look as if written by a Copt, from their resemblance
to Coptic letters<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a>: the shapes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">iota</span></span> are
specially noticeable. Birch had previously collated the Greek
text. Notwithstanding the occasional presence of the rough
and smooth breathing in this copy (p. <a href="#Pg047" class="tei tei-ref">47</a>)<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>, Giorgi refers it to
the fourth century, Tischendorf to the fifth. The Greek
fragment of St. Luke was first collated by Mr. Bradley H.
Alford, and inserted by his brother, Dean Alford, in the fourth
edition of his Greek Testament, vol. i (1859). Dr. Tregelles
had drawn Mr. Alford's attention to it, from a hint thrown out
by Zoega, in p. 184 of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Catalogus codd. Copt. MSS. qui in
Museo Borgiano Velitris adservantur.”</span> Romae, 1810.

T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">s</span></span> or T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">woi</span></span> is used by Tischendorf to indicate a few leaves in
Greek and Thebaic, which once belonged to Woide, and were
published with his other Thebaic fragments in Ford's Appendix
to the Codex Alexandrinus, Oxon. 1799. They contain Luke
xii. 15-xiii. 32; John viii. 33-42 (eighty-five verses). From the
second fragment it plainly appears (what the similarity of the
facsimiles had suggested to Tregelles) that T and T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">s</span></span> are parts
of the same manuscript, for the page of T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">s</span></span> which contains John
viii. 33 in Greek exhibits on its reverse the Thebaic version of
John viii. 23-32, of which T affords us only the Greek text.
This fact was first noted by Tischendorf (N. T. 1859), who adds
that the Coptic scribe blundered much over the Greek: e.g.
βαβουσα Luke xiii. 21; so δεκαι for δεκα και, ver. 16. He
transcribed T and T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">woi</span></span> (as well as T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span>, T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>, T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">d</span></span>, which we proceed
to describe), for publication in the ninth volume of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta
sacra inedita”</span> (1870), but owing to his death they never
appeared. But Bp. Lightfoot gives reasons (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see below</span></span>, vol. ii.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span> at St. Petersburg much resembles the preceding in the
Coptic-like style of writing, but is not earlier than the sixth
century. It contains on six octavo leaves John i. 25-42; ii. 9-iv.
50, spaces left in the text answering the purpose of stops.
T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span> has a harmony of the Gospels at the foot of the page.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span> is a fragment of about twenty-one verses between Matt.
xiv. 19 and xv. 8, also of the sixth century, and at St. Petersburg,
in the collection of Bishop Porphyry. Its text in the
twenty-nine places cited by Tischendorf in his eighth edition
accords with Cod. א twenty-four times, with Cod. B twenty
times, with Codd. C and D sixteen times each, with Cod. 33
nine times. Cod. A is wanting here. Compared with these
primary authorities severally, it agrees with א alone once, with
33 alone twice, with אB united against the rest four times: so
that its critical character is very decided.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">d</span></span> is a fragment of a Lectionary, Greek and Sahidic, of
about the seventh century, found by Tischendorf in 1866 among
the Borgian manuscripts at Rome. It contains Matt. xvi.
13-20; Mark i. 3-8, xii. 35-37; John xix. 23-27; xx. 30-31:
twenty-four verses only. This fragment and the next have
been brought into this place, rather than inserted in the list of
Evangelistaria, because they both contained fragments of the
Thebaic version.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">e</span></span> is a fragment of St. Matthew at Cambridge (Univ. Libr.
Addit. 1875). Dr. Hort communicated its readings to Dr. C. R.
Gregory, for his Prolegomena to the eighth edition of Tischendorf's
N. T. It is <span class="tei tei-q">“a tiny morsel”</span> of an uncial Lectionary of
the sixth century, containing only Matt. iii. 13-16, the parallel
column probably in the Thebaic version having perished. It was
brought, among other Coptic fragments, from Upper Egypt by
Mr. Greville Chester. Dr. Hort kindly enables me to add to
his description of T<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">e</span></span> (Addenda to Tregelles' N. T. p. 1070) that
this <span class="tei tei-q">“tiny morsel”</span> is irregular in shape, frequently less than four

inches in width and height, the uncial Greek letters being three-eighths
of an inch high. There seem to have been two columns of
either eight or more probably of twenty-four lines each on a page,
but no Coptic portions survive. <span class="tei tei-q">“If of twenty-four lines the
fragment might belong to the inner column of a bilingual MS.
with the two languages in parallel columns, or to the outer
column of a wholly Greek MS. or of a bilingual MS. with the
section in the two languages consecutively, as in Mr. Horner's
Graeco-Thebaic fragment (Evst. 299: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg398" class="tei tei-ref">398</a>). In the latter
case it might belong to the inner column of a wholly Greek MS.
or of a bilingual MS. with the section in two consecutive

that the columns were of eight lines only.”</span> (Hort.)

gives a facsimile of it, assigning it to the eighth century. Judging
from Matthaei's plate, it is hard to say why others have dated
it in the ninth. It contained in 1779, when first collated,
the Four Gospels in 8vo with the sections and Eusebian canons,
in uncial letters down to John vii. 39, ουπω γαρ ην, and from
that point in cursive letters of the thirteenth century, Matt. v. 44-vi.

stichometry by a diligent scribe: its resemblance to Cod. M has
been already mentioned. The cursive portion is Matthaei's V,
Scholz's Evan. 250.

Mark ii. 8-16; Luke i. 20-32; 64-79 (thirty-five verses), which
have been washed to make a palimpsest, and the writing erased
in parts by a knife. There are also some traces of a Latin
version, but all these were used up to bind other books in
the library of St. Gall. They are of the eighth century, or the
ninth according to Tischendorf, edd. 7 and 8, and have appeared
in vol. iii of <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita,”</span> with a facsimile, whose
style closely resembles that of Cod. Δ, and its kindred FG of

W<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">d</span></span> was discovered in 1857 by Mr. W. White, sub-librarian of
Trinity College, Cambridge, in the College Library, and was
afterwards observed, and arranged by Mr. H. Bradshaw,
University Librarian, its slips (about twenty-seven in number)
having been worked into the binding of a volume of Gregory
Nazianzen: they are now carefully arranged under glass (B. viii.
5). They comprise portions of four leaves, severally containing
Mark vii. 3-4; 6-8; 30-36; 36-viii. 4; 4-10; 11-16; ix. 2;
7-9, in uncial letters of the ninth century, if not rather earlier,
slightly leaning to the right. The sections are set in the
margin without the Eusebian canons, with a table of harmony
at the foot of each page of twenty-four lines. The τίτλοι are
in red at the top and bottom of the pages, their corresponding
numerals in the margin. The breathings and accents are
often very faint: lessons and musical notes, crosses, &amp;c. are in
red, and sometimes cover the original stops. In text it much
resembles Codd. אBDLΔ: one reading (Mark vii. 33) appears to
be unique. Dr. Scrivener has included it in a volume of fresh
collations of manuscripts and editions which is shortly to appear
under the accomplished editorship of Mr. J. Rendel Harris.

X. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Monacensis</span></span>, in the University Library at Munich
(No. 1/26), is a valuable folio manuscript of the end of the ninth
or early in the tenth century, containing the Four Gospels
(in the order described above, with serious omissions)<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a>, and
a commentary (chiefly from Chrysostom) surrounding and
interspersed with the text of all but St. Mark, in early cursive
letters, not unlike (in Tischendorf's judgement) the celebrated
Oxford Plato dated 895. The very elegant uncials of Cod. X
<span class="tei tei-q">“are small and upright; though some of them are compressed,
they seem as if they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial</span></em> imitations of those used in
very early copies”</span> (Tregelles' Horne, p. 195). Each page has
two columns of about forty-five lines each. There are no
divisions by κεφάλαια or sections, nor notes to serve for ecclesiastical
use. From a memorandum we find that it came from
Rome to Ingoldstadt, as a present from Gerard Vossius [1577-1649];
from Ingoldstadt it was taken to Landshut in 1803,
thence to Munich in 1827. When it was at Ingoldstadt Griesbach
obtained some extracts from it through Dobrowsky; Scholz
first collated it, but in his usual unhappy way; Tischendorf in
1844, Tregelles in 1846. Dean Burgon examined it in 1872.

Y. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Barberini</span></span> 225 at Rome (in the Library founded
by Cardinal Barberini in the seventeenth century) contains on
six large leaves the 137 verses John xvi. 3-xix. 41, of about
the eighth century. Tischendorf obtained access to it in 1843
for a few hours, after some difficulty with the Prince Barberini,
and published it in his first instalment of <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra
inedita,”</span> 1846. Scholz had first noticed, and loosely collated
it. A later hand has coarsely retraced the letters, but the
ancient writing is plain and good. Accents and breathings are
most often neglected or placed wrongly: κ θ τ [each with a small symbol after and below the character] are frequent
at the end of lines. For punctuation one, two, three or
even four points are employed, the power of the single point
varying as in Codd. E Θ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span> and B of the Apocalypse. The
pseudo-Ammonian sections are without the Eusebian canons:
and such forms as λήμψεται xvi. 14, λήμψεσθε ver. 24 occur.
These few uncial leaves are prefixed to a cursive copy of the
Gospels with Theophylact's commentary (Evan. 392): the text
is mixed, and lies about midway between that of Cod. A and
Cod. B.

Z. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Dublinensis rescriptus</span></span>, one of the chief palimpsests
extant, contains 295 verses of St. Matthew's Gospel in
twenty-two fragments<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>. It is of a small quarto size, originally
10-½ inches by 8, now reduced to 8-¼ inches by 6, once containing
120 leaves arranged in quaternions, of which the first that
remains bears the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signature</span></em> 13 (ΙΓ): fourteen sheets or double
leaves and four single leaves being all that survive. It was
discovered in 1787 by Dr. John Barrett, Senior Fellow of Trinity
College, Dublin, under some cursive writing of the tenth century
or later, consisting of Chrysostom de Sacerdotio, extracts from
Epiphanius, &amp;c. In the same volume are portions of Isaiah
(eight leaves) and of Gregory Nazianzen, in erased uncial letters,
the latter not so ancient as the fragment of St. Matthew. All
the thirty-two leaves of this Gospel that remain were engraved
in copper-plate facsimile<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> at the expense of Trinity College, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
published by Barrett in 1801, furnished with Prolegomena, and
the contents of each facsimile plate in modern Greek characters,
on the opposite page. The facsimiles are not very accurate, and
the form of the letters is stated to be less free and symmetrical
than in the original: yet from these plates (for the want of
a better guide) our alphabet (No. <a href="#Plate_II" class="tei tei-ref">6</a>) and specimen (No. <a href="#Plate_VII" class="tei tei-ref">18</a>) have
been taken. The Greek type on the opposite page was not
very well revised, and a comparison with the copper-plate will
occasionally convict it of errors, which have been animadverted
upon more severely than was quite necessary. The Prolegomena
were encumbered with a discussion of our Lord's genealogies
quite foreign to the subject, and the tone of scholarship is not
very high; but Barrett's judgement on the manuscript is correct
in the main, and his conclusion, that it is as old as the sixth
century, has been generally received. Tregelles in 1853 was
permitted to apply a chemical mixture to the vellum, which
was already miserably discoloured, apparently from the purple
dye: he was thus enabled to add a little (about 200 letters)
to what Barrett had read long since<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a>, but he found that in
most places which that editor had left blank, the vellum had
been cut away or lost: it would no doubt have been better
for Barrett to have stated, in each particular case, why he had
been unable to give the text of the passage. A far better
edition of the manuscript, including the fragment of Isaiah,
and a newly-discovered leaf of the Latin Codex Palatinus
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>), with Prolegomena and two plates of real facsimiles, was
published in 1880 by T. K. Abbott, B.D., Professor of Biblical
Greek in the University of Dublin. He has read 400 letters
hitherto deemed illegible, and is inclined to assign the fifth
century as the date of the Codex. Codex Z, like many others,
and for the same orthographical reasons, has been referred to
Alexandria as its native country. It is written with a single
column on each page of twenty-one or twenty-three lines<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a>.
The so-named Ammonian sections are given, but not the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eusebian canons: the τίτλοι are written at the top of the pages
by a later hand according to Porter and Abbott, though this
may be questioned (Gebhardt and Harnack's <span class="tei tei-q">“Texte,”</span> &amp;c., I. iv.
p. xxiii ff., 1883), their numbers being set in the margin. The
writing is continuous, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">single</span></em> point either rarely found or
quite washed out: the abbreviations are very few, and there
are no breathings or accents. Like Cod. B, this manuscript
indicates citations by &gt; in the margin, and it represents N
by —, but only at the end of a word and line. A space,
proportionate to the occasion, is usually left when there is
a break in the sense, and capitals extend into the margin
when a new section begins. The letters are in a plain,
steady, beautiful hand: they yield in elegance to none, and are
never compressed at the end of a line. The shape of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span>
(which varies a good deal), and especially that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mu</span></span>, is very
peculiar: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phi</span></span> is inordinately large: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span> has an upper curve
which is not usual: the same curves appear also in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zeta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lambda</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">chi</span></span>. The characters are less in size than in N, about equal
to those in R, much greater than in AB. In regard to the text,
it agrees much with Codd. אBD: with Cod. A it has only
twenty-three verses in common: yet in them A and Z vary
fourteen times. Mr. Abbott adds that while אBZ stand together
ten times against other uncials, BZ are never alone, but אZ
against B often. It is freer than either of them from transcriptural
errors. Codd. אBCZ combine less often than אBDZ. On
examining Cod. Z throughout twenty-six pages, he finds it alone
thirteen times, differing from א thirty times, from B forty-four
times, from Stephen's text ninety-five times. Thus it approaches
nearer to א than to B.

Γ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Tischendorfian.</span></span> IV was brought by Tischendorf
from an <span class="tei tei-q">“eastern monastery”</span> (he usually describes the locality
of his manuscripts in such like general terms), and was bought
of him for the Bodleian Library (Misc. Gr. 313) in 1855. It
consists of 158 leaves, 12 inches x 9-¼, with one column (of
twenty-four not very straight or regular lines) on a page,
in uncials of the ninth century, leaning slightly back, but
otherwise much resembling Cod. K in style (facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_XII" class="tei tei-ref">35</a>).
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
St. Luke's Gospel is complete; the last ten leaves are hurt
by damp, though still legible. In St. Mark only 105 verses
are wanting (iii. 35-vi. 20); about 531 verses of the other
Gospels survive<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>. Tischendorf, and Tregelles by his leave, have
independently collated this copy, of which Tischendorf gives
a facsimile in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Anecdota sacra et profana,”</span> 1855. Some of its
peculiar readings are very notable, and few uncials of its date
deserve that more careful study, which it has hardly yet
received. In 1859 Tischendorf, on his return from his third
Eastern journey, took to St. Petersburg ninety-nine additional
leaves of this self-same manuscript, doubtless procured from the
same place as he had obtained the Bodleian portion six years
before (Notitia Cod. Sinait. p. 53). This copy of the Gospels,
though unfortunately in two distant libraries, is now nearly
perfect<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>, and at the end of St. John's Gospel, in the more
recently discovered portion, we find an inscription which seems
to fix the date: ετελειωθη ἡ δέλτος αὔτη μηνι νοεμβριω <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">κζ</span></span>, ινδ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">η</span></span>,

<span class="tei tei-q">“Calendarium chronologum medii potissimum aevi monumentis
accommodatum,”</span> Vienn. 1781, pp. vii, 11, 105, states that the
only year between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 800 and 950, on which the Indiction was
eight, and Nov. 27 fell on a Thursday, was 844<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>. In the Oxford
sheets we find tables of κεφάλαια before the Gospels of
SS. Matthew and Luke; the τίτλοι at the heading of the pages;
their numbers <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rubro</span></span> neatly set in the margin; capitals in red at
the commencement of these chapters; the ἀρχαὶ καὶ τέλη of
lections; the sections and Eusebian canons in their usual places,
and some liturgical directions. Over the original breathings and
accents some late scrawler has in many places put others, in
a very careless fashion.

Δ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Sangallensis</span></span>, was first inspected by Gerbert
(1773), named by Scholz (N. T. 1830), and made fully known
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to us by the admirable edition in lithographed facsimile of
every page, by H. Ch. M. Rettig [1799-1836], published at
Zurich, 1836<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>, with copious and satisfactory Prolegomena. It
is preserved and was probably transcribed a thousand years since
in the great monastery of St. Gall in the north-east of Switzerland
(Stifts bibliothek, 48). It is rudely written on 197 leaves
of coarse vellum quarto, 8-7/8 inches by 7-1/8 in size, with from twenty
to twenty-six (usually twenty-one) lines on each page, in a very
peculiar hand, with an interlinear Latin version, and contains
the four Gospels complete except John xix. 17-35. Before
St. Matthew's Gospel are placed Prologues, Latin verses, the
Eusebian canons in Roman letters, tables of the κεφάλαια both
in Greek and Latin, &amp;c. Rettig thinks he has traced several
different scribes and inks employed on it, which might happen
easily enough in the Scriptorium of a monastery; but, if so,
their style of writing is very nearly the same, and they doubtless
copied from the same archetype, about the same time. He has
produced more convincing arguments to show that Cod. Δ is
part of the same book as the Codex Boernerianus, G of St. Paul's
Epistles. Not only do they exactly resemble each other in their
whole arrangement and appearance, but marginal notes by the
first hand are found in each, of precisely the same character.
Thus the predestinarian doctrines of the heretic Godeschalk
[d. 866] are pointed out for refutation at the hard texts, Luke
xiii. 24; John xii. 40 in Δ, and six times in G<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>. St. Mark's
Gospel represents a text different from that of the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Evangelists, and the Latin version (which is clearly <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ
manu</span></span>) seems a mixture of the Vulgate with the older Italic, so
altered and accommodated to the Greek as to be of little critical
value. The penmen seem to have known but little Greek, and
to have copied from a manuscript written continuously, for the
divisions between the words are sometimes absurdly wrong.
There are scarcely any breathings or accents, except about the
opening of St. Mark, and once an aspirate to ἑπτα; what we do
find are often falsely given; and a dot is set in most places
regularly at the end of every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></em> word. The letters have

decidedly of the latest uncial type. Here, as in Paul. Cod. G,
the mark &gt;&gt;&gt; is much used to fill up vacant spaces. The
text from which Δ was copied seems to have been arranged
in στίχοι, for almost every line has at least one Greek capital

lines, taken almost at random, from pp. 80-1 (Matt. xx. 13-15),
in order to explain our meaning:

It will be observed that, while in Cod. Δ a line begins at any
place, even in the middle of a word; if the capital letters be
assumed to commence the lines, the text divides itself into
regular στίχοι. See above, pp. <a href="#Pg052" class="tei tei-ref">52-54</a>. Here are also the τίτλοι,
the sections and canons. The letters Ν and ι, Ζ and Ξ, Τ and
Θ, Ρ and the Latin R are perpetually confounded. Facsimiles of
Luke i. 1-9 may be seen in Pal. Soc. xi. 179. As in the kindred
Codd. Augiensis and Boernerianus the Latin f is much like r.
Tregelles has noted ι ascript in Cod. Δ, but this is rare. There
is no question that this document was written by Latin (most
probably by Irish) monks, in the west of Europe, during the
ninth century (or the tenth, Pal. Soc.).  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">See below</span></span>, Paul. Cod. G.

Tischendorf in 1845, published by him in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra
inedita,”</span> 1846, with a few supplements in vol. ii of his new
collection (1857), and deposited in the University Library at
Leipsic. It consists of but four leaves (all imperfect) quarto, of
very thin vellum, almost too brittle to be touched, so that each leaf
is kept separately in glass. It contains about forty-two verses;
viz. Matt. xii. 17-19; 23-25; xiii. 46-55 (in mere shreds); xiv.
8-29; xv. 4-14, with the greater κεφάλαια in red; the sections
and Eusebian canons stand in the inner margin. A few breathings
are <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>, and many accents by two later correctors.
The stops (which are rather numerous) resemble those of Cod.
Y, only that four points are not found in Θ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">a</span></span>. Tischendorf
places its date towards the end of the seventh century, assigning
Mount Sinai or lower Egypt for its country. The uncials (especially
ΕΘΟΣ) are somewhat oblong, leaning to the right (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span>
p. <a href="#Pg041" class="tei tei-ref">41</a> note), but the writing is elegant and uniform; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span> keeps
its ancient shape, and the diameter of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span> does not extend

Seven other small fragments, of which four and part of another
are from the manuscripts of Bishop Porphyry at St. Petersburg,
were intended to be included in Tischendorf's ninth volume of
<span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita”</span> (1870), but owing to Tischendorf's
death they never appeared. That active critic had brought two
(Θ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">d</span></span>) and part of another (Θ<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>) from the East, and deposited

know it, exactly resembles that of Cod. Γ, and like it is now in
the Bodleian (Auct. T. Infra I. 1). It contains 157 leaves,
written in two columns of twenty-three lines each, in small,
oblong, clumsy, sloping uncials of the eighth or rather of the
ninth century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg041" class="tei tei-ref">41</a>, note 1, and facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_XI" class="tei tei-ref">30</a>). It has the
Gospels of St. Luke and St. John complete, with the subscription
to St. Mark, each Gospel being preceded by tables of κεφάλαια,
with the τίτλοι at the heads of the pages; the numbers of the
κεφάλαια, of the sections, and of the Eusebian canons (these last
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rubro</span></span>) being set in the margin. There are also scholia interspersed,
of some critical value; a portion being in uncial
characters. This copy also was described (with a facsimile) by
Tischendorf, Anecdota sacra et profana, 1855, and collated by
himself and Tregelles. Its text is said to vary greatly from
that common in the later uncials, and to be very like Scholz's
262 (Paris 53). For ι <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ascriptum</span></span> see p. <a href="#Pg044" class="tei tei-ref">44</a>, note 2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here again the history of this manuscript curiously coincides
with that of Cod. Γ. In his Notitia Cod. Sinaitici, p. 58,
Tischendorf describes an early cursive copy of St. Matthew and
St. Mark (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the subscription to the latter being wanting</span></em>), which
he took to St. Petersburg in 1859, so exactly corresponding in
general appearance with Cod. Λ (although that be written in
uncial characters), as well as in the style and character of the
marginal scholia, which are often in small uncials, that he pronounces
them part of the same codex. Very possibly he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em>
have added that he procured the two from the same source:
at any rate the subscription to St. Matthew at St. Petersburg
precisely resembles the other three subscriptions at Oxford, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those in Paris 53 (Scholz's 262)<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>, with which Tischendorf
had previously compared Cod. Λ (N. T. Proleg. p. clxxvii, seventh
edition). These cursive leaves are preceded by Eusebius' Epistle
to Carpianus, his table of canons, and a table of the κεφάλαια of
St. Matthew. The τίτλοι in uncials head the pages, and their
numbers stand in the margin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the marginal scholia Tischendorf cites the following
notices of the Jewish Gospel, or that according to the Hebrews,
which certainly have their value as helping to inform us respecting
its nature: Matt. iv. 5 το ιουδαικον ουκ εχει εις την αγιαν πολιν αλλ
εν <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">ιλημ</span></span>. xvi. 17 Βαριωνα; το ιουδαικον υιε ιωαννου. xviii. 22 το
ιουδαικον εξης εχει μετα το ἑβδομηκοντακις ἑπτα; και γαρ εν τοις προφηταις
μετα το χρισθηναι αυτους εν <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">πνι</span></span> ἁγιω εὑρισκετω (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>) εν
αυτοις λογος ἁμαρτιας:—an addition which Jerome (contra Pelag.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">iii</span></span>) expressly cites from the Gospel of the Nazarenes. xxvi. 47
το ιουδαικον; και ηρνησατο και ωμοσεν και κατηρασατο. It is plain
that this whole matter requires careful discussion, but at present
it would seem that the first half of Cod. Λ was written in cursive,
the second in uncial letters; if not by the same person, yet on
the same plan and at the same place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ξ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Zacynthius</span></span> is a palimpsest in the Library of the
British and Foreign Bible Society in London, which, under
a cursive Evangelistarium written on coarse vellum in or about
the thirteenth century, contains large portions (342 verses) of
St. Luke, down to ch. xi. 33<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a>, in full well-formed uncials, but
surrounded by and often interwoven with large extracts from
the Fathers, in a hand so cramped and, as regards the round
letters (ΕΘΟΣ), so oblong, that it cannot be earlier than the
eighth century, although some such compressed forms occur in
Cod. P of the sixth (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg144" class="tei tei-ref">144</a>). The general absence of accents
and breathings also would favour an earlier date. As the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
arrangement of the matter makes it certain that the commentary
is contemporaneous, Cod. Ξ must be regarded as the earliest
known, indeed as the only uncial, copy furnished with
a catena. This volume, which once belonged to <span class="tei tei-q">“Il Principe
Comuto, Zante,”</span> and is marked as Μνημόσυνον σεβάσματος τοῦ
Ἱππέος Ἀντωνίου Κόμητος 1820, was presented to the Bible
Society in 1821 by General Macaulay, who brought it from Zante.
Mr. Knolleke, one of the Secretaries, seems first to have noticed
the older writing, and on the discovery being communicated to
Tregelles in 1858 by Dr. Paul de Lagarde of Berlin, with
characteristic eagerness that critic examined, deciphered, and
published the Scripture text, together with the Moscow
fragment O, in 1861: he doubted whether the small Patristic
writing could all be read without chemical restoration. Besides
the usual τίτλοι above the text and other notations of sections,
and numbers running up from 1 to 100 which refer to the catena,
this copy is remarkable for possessing also the division into
chapters, hitherto as has been stated deemed unique in Cod. B.
To this notation is commonly prefixed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">psi</span></span>, formed like a cross,
in the fashion of the eighth century. The ancient volume must
have been a large folio (14 inches by 11), of which eighty-six
leaves and three half-leaves survive: of course very hard to
read. Of the ecclesiastical writers cited by name Chrysostom,
Origen, and Cyril are the best known.  In text it
generally favours the B and א and their company. In the 564
places wherein Tischendorf cites it in his eighth edition, it
supports Cod. L in full three cases out of four, and those the
most characteristic. It stands alone only fourteen times, and with
Cod. L or others against the five great uncials only thirty times.
In regard to these five, Cod. Ξ sides plainly with Cod. B in
preference to Cod. A, following B alone seven times, BL twenty-four
times, but א thirteen times, A fifteen times, C (which is
often defective) five times, D fourteen times, with none of these
unsupported except with א once. Their combinations in agreement
with Ξ are curious and complicated, but lead to the same
result.  This copy is with אB six times, with אBL fifty-five;
with אBC twenty, but with אBD as many as fifty-four times,
with אBCD thirty-eight times; with BCD thrice, with BC six
times, with BD thirteen. It combines with אA ten times, with
AC fifteen, with AD eleven, with אAC sixteen, with ACD twelve,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with אAD six, with אACD twelve. Thus Cod. Ξ favours
B against A 226 times, A against B ninety-seven. Combinations
of its readings opposed to both A and B are אC six, אD eight,
CD two, אCD three. In the other passages it favours ABC
against אD eleven times, ABCD against א eight times, אABC
against D eighteen times, אABD against C, or where C is
defective, thirty-nine times, and is expressly cited twenty-seven
times as standing with אABCD against later copies. The
character of the variations of Cod. Ξ from the Received text may
be judged of by the estimate made by some scholar, that forty-seven
of them are transpositions in the order of the words, 201
are substitutions of one word for another, 118 are omissions,
while the additions do not exceed twenty-four (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian
Remembrancer</span></span>, January, 1862). The cursive Evangelistarium
written over the uncial is noticed below, and bears the
mark 200*.

Π. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Petropolitanus</span></span> consists of 350 vellum leaves in
small quarto, and contains the Gospels complete except Matt. iii.
12-iv. 18; xix. 12-xx. 3; John viii. 6-39; seventy-seven verses.
A century since it belonged to Parodus, a noble Greek of Smyrna,
and its last possessor was persuaded by Tischendorf, in 1859, to
present it to the Emperor of Russia. Tischendorf states that it
is of the age of the later uncials (meaning the ninth century),
but of higher critical importance than most of them, and much
like Cod. K in its rarer readings. There are many marginal and
other corrections by a later hand, and John v. 4; viii. 3-6 are
obelized. In the table of κεφάλαια before St. Mark, there is a
gap after <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">λϛ</span></span>: Mark xvi. 18-20; John xxi. 22-25 are in a later
hand. At the end of St. Mark, the last section inserted is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">σλδ</span></span>
by the side of ἀναστὰς δέ ver. 9, with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">η</span></span> under it for the Eusebian
canon. Tischendorf first used its readings for his Synopsis
Evangelica 1864, then for the eighth edition of his Greek
Testament 1865, &amp;c. This manuscript in the great majority of
instances sides with the later uncials (whether supported by
Cod. A or not) against Codd. אBCD united.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Σ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Rossanensis</span></span>, like Cod. N described above, is a manuscript
written on thin vellum leaves stained purple, in silver
letters, the first three lines of each Gospel being in gold. Like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Cod. D it probably dates from the sixth century, if not a little
sooner, and is the earliest known copy of Scripture which is
adorned with miniatures in watercolours, seventeen in number,
very interesting and in good preservation. The illustrated
Dioscorides at Vienna bears about the same date. Attention
was called to the book by Cesare Malpica in 1846, but it was not
seen by any one who cared to use it before March, 1879, when
Oscar von Gebhardt of Göttingen and Adolf Harnack of Giessen,
in their search for codices of Hippolytus, of Dionysius of
Alexandria, and of Cyril of Jerusalem, described by Cardinal
Sirlet in 1582, found it in the Archbishop's Library at Rossano,
a small city in Calabria, and published an account of it in 1880
in a sumptuous form, far more satisfactory to the artist than to
the Biblical critic. Their volume is illustrated by two facsimile
leaves, of one of which a reduction may be seen in our Plate xiv,
No. 43. A copy of the manuscripts was published at Leipsic in
1883 with an Introduction by Oscar von Gebhardt, the Text being
edited by Adolf Harnack<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a>. The page we have exhibited gives
the earliest MS. authority, except Φ, for the doxology in the
Lord's Prayer, Matt. vi. 13. The manuscript is in quarto,
13-½ inches high by 10-¼ broad, and now contains only the
Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark on 188 leaves of two
columns each, there being twenty lines in each column of very
regular writing, and from nine to twelve letters in each line. It
ends abruptly at Mark xvi. 14, and the last ten leaves have
suffered from damp; otherwise the writing (especially on the
inner or smooth side of the vellum) is in good preservation, and
the colours of the paintings wonderfully fresh. The binding is
of strong black leather, about 200 years old. As in Cod. B, the
sheets are ranged in quinions, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signatures</span></em> in silver by
the original scribe standing at the lower border of each quire on
the right, and the pages being marked in the upper border in
modern black ink. In Cod. Σ there is no separation between
the words, it has no breathings or accents. Capital letters stand
outside the columns, being about twice the size of the rest, and
the smaller letters at the end of lines are not compressed, as we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
find them even in Cod. P (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> pp. <a href="#Pg144" class="tei tei-ref">144</a>, <a href="#Pg163" class="tei tei-ref">163</a>). The letters are
round and square, and, as was abundantly seen above (pp. <a href="#Pg033" class="tei tei-ref">33-40</a>),
belong to the older type of writing. The punctuation is very
simple: the full stop occurs half up the letter. There are few
erasures, but transcriptural errors are mostly corrected in silver
letters by the original scribe. To St. Matthew's Gospel is prefixed
Eusebius' Epistle to Carpianus and his Tables of Canons,
both imperfect; also lists of the κεφάλαια <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">majora</span></span> and τίτλοι in the
upper margins of the several leaves, with a subscription to the
first Gospel (Ευαγγελιον κατα ματθαιον). This supplementary matter
is written somewhat smaller, but (as the editors judge) by the
same hand as the text, although the letters are somewhat more
recent in general appearance, and ι <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ascriptum</span></span> occurs, as it never
does in the body of the manuscript: [symbol] also is only twice abridged
in the text, but often in the smaller writing. In the margin of the
Greek text the Ammonian sections stand in minute characters over
the numbers of the Eusebian canons. The text agrees but slightly
with א or B, and rather with the main body of uncials and cursives,
which it favours in about a proportion of three to one. With the
cognate purple manuscript Cod. N it accords so wonderfully, that
although one of them cannot have been copied directly from the
other, they must have been drawn directly or indirectly from the
same source. Strong proofs of the affinity between N and Σ are

Traditional Text, but not invariably. We find here the usual
itacisms, as ει for ι, αι for ε, η for ει and ι, ου for ω, and vice
versa; even ο for ω, which is rarer in very ancient copies. The
so-called Alexandrian forms ἤλθατε, ἐλθάτω, ἴδαμεν, ἴδαν for verbs,
τρίχαν and νύκταν for nouns, ἐκαθερίσθη, λήμψομαι, δεκατέσσερες,
τεσσεράκοντα, it has in common with all copies approaching it
in age.

thirty-three of the leaves: viz. Matt. i. 1-14; v. 3-19; xii. 27-41;
xxiii. 5-xxv. 30; 43-xxvi. 26; 50-xxvii. 17. Mark i. 1-42;
ii. 21-v. 1; 29-vi. 22; x. 50-xi. 13. Luke xvi. 21-xvii. 3;
19-37; xix. 15-31. John ii. 18-iii. 5; iv. 23-37; v. 35-vi. 2:
in all 484 verses. In 1883, Dr. Gregory discovered two more
leaves, making thirty-six in all, with a reduction of the passages
to sixteen by filling up an hiatus, and giving a total of 497
verses. It is probable that writing lies under all the 108
leaves. It exhibits <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Am.</span></span> (not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eus.</span></span>) in gold, ἀρχαί and τέλη,
but is very hard to read, and has not yet been collated. Of
less account are palimpsest pieces of the eleventh century on
some of the leaves, containing Matt. xi. 13, &amp;c.; Luke i. 64, &amp;c.;
ii. 25-34, and a later cursive patch (fol. 23) containing
Mark vi. 14-20.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Φ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Beratinus.</span></span> This symbol was taken by Herr
Oscar von Gebhardt to denote the imaginary parent of Cursives
13, 69, 124, 346, of which the similarity has been traced by the
late W. H. Ferrar and Dr. T. K. Abbott in <span class="tei tei-q">“A Collection of Four
Important MSS.”</span> (1877). But it is now permanently affixed to
an Uncial MS. seen by M. Pierre Batiffol on the instigation of
Prof. Duchesne in 1875 at Berat or Belgrade in Albania. This
manuscript had been previously described by Mgr. Anthymus
Alexoudi, Orthodox Metropolitan of Belgrade, in an account of
his diocese published in 1868 in Corfu. According to M. Batiffol,
it is a purple manuscript, written in silver letters on vellum,
an <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">édition de grande luxe</span></span>, and therefore open to the charge
brought by St. Jerome in his Prolegomena to Job against
the great adornment of manuscripts, as being far from constituting
an index of accuracy. It contains 190 unpaged leaves
in quaternions, firmly sewn together, having two columns in
a page of seventeen lines each, and from eight to twelve words
in a line. The leaves are in size about 12-¼ inches by 10-½, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the columns measure 8-¼ inches high by rather more than 4-¼
broad. The pages have the κεφάλαια marked at the top, and the
sections and canons in writing of the eighth century at the side.
The letters are in silver, very regular, and clearly written.
None are in gold, except the title and the first line in St. Mark,
and the words Πατήρ, Ἰησοῦς, and some others in the first six
folios. There is no ornamentation, but the first letters of
paragraphs are twice as large as the other letters. The letters
have no decoration, except a cross in the middle of the initial O's.
The writing is continuous in full line without stichometry.
Quotations from the Old Testament are marked with a kind of
inverted comma. There are no breathings, or accents. Punctuation
is made only with the single comma or double comma,
consisting of a point slightly elongated much like a modern
written comma, and placed at about mid-height, or else with
a vacant space, or by passing to the next line. The apostrophe
is not always used to mark elisions, but is generally put after
Ρ final. Abbreviations are of the most ancient kind. The
character of the letters may be seen in the specimen given above,
No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">43</a>. Altogether, the Codex Beratinus (Φ) may probably be
placed at the end of the fifth century, a little before the
Dioscorides (506 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), and before the Codex Rossanensis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the character of the text, it inclines to the large body
of Uncials and Cursives, and is rarely found with Bא and Z of
St. Matthew or Δ of St. Mark. A specimen examination of fifty
passages at the beginning of St. Matthew gives forty-four
instances in which it agrees with the larger body of Uncials and
Cursives, six when it passes over to the other side, whilst in
thirty-eight it agrees with Σ. In the same passages, Σ agrees
thirty-eight times with the larger body, and twelve times with
א or B. Like Σ it contains the doxology in Matt. vi. 13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Codex Φ has gone through many vicissitudes. It has perhaps
been at Patmos, where it may have been mutilated by some
of the Crusaders, and at Antioch. It contains only St. Matthew
and St. Mark; a note says that the disappearance of St. Luke
and St. John is due to the Franks of Champagne. The first six
folios are in a bad state, so that the text as we have it does not
begin till St. Matt. vi. 3 η αριστερα σου κ.τ.λ. Hiatus occurs
Matt. vii. 26-viii. 7, in xviii. 23-xix. 3, and in Mark xiv. 62-fin.
So that Cod. Φ presents no direct evidence—only the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
testimony to the general character of its companions derived
from its own character and general coincidence—upon the last
twelve verses of St. Mark. Part of folio 112, at the end of
St. Matthew, is blank, and folios 113, 114, contain the κεφάλαια
of St. Mark.

E. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Laudianus</span></span> 35 is one of the most precious treasures
preserved in the Bodleian at Oxford. It is a Latin-Greek copy,
with two columns on a page, the Latin version holding the post
of honour on the left, and is written in very short στίχοι
consisting of from one to three words each, the Latin words
always standing opposite to the corresponding Greek. This
peculiar arrangement points decisively to the West of Europe
as its country, notwithstanding the abundance of Alexandrian
forms has led some to refer it to Egypt. The very large, bold,
thick, rude uncials, without break in the words and without
accents, lead us up to the end of the sixth century as its date. The
Latin is not of Jerome's or the Vulgate version, but is made to
correspond closely with the Greek, even in its interpolations and
rarest various readings. The contrary supposition that the
Greek portion of this codex <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latinised</span></em>, or had been altered to
coincide with the Latin, is inconsistent with the facts of the case.
This manuscript contains only the Acts of the Apostles (from
ch. xxvi. 29 παυλος to ch. xxviii. 26 λέγον being lost), and
exhibits a remarkable modification of the text, of which we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall speak in Chapter <a href="#Chapter_VII" class="tei tei-ref">VII</a>. That the book was once in Sardinia,
appears from an edict of Flavius Pancratius, συν θεω απο επαρχων
δουξ σαρδινιας, appended (as also is the Apostles' Creed in Latin,
and some other foreign matter) in a later hand: Imperial
governors ruled in that island with the title of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">dux</span></span> from the
reign of Justinian, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 534 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 749. It was probably among
the Greek volumes brought into England by the fellow-countryman
of St. Paul, Theodore of Tarsus<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the grand old man”</span> as
he has been called by one of kindred spirit to his own (Dean
Hook, Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, vol. i. p. 150),
who came to England as Primate at the age of sixty-six, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 668,
and died in 690. At all events, Mill (N. T. Proleg. §§ 1022-6)<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a>
has rendered it all but certain, that the Venerable Bede [d. 735]
had this very codex before him when he wrote his <span class="tei tei-q">“Expositio
Retractata”</span> of the Acts<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a>, and Woide (Notitia Cod. Alex., p. 156,
&amp;c.) has since alleged six additional instances of agreement
between them. The manuscript, however, must have been
complete when Bede used it, for he cites in the Latin ch. xxvii. 5;
xxviii. 2. Tischendorf (Proleg. p. xv) adds ch. xxvii. 1, 7, 14,
15, 16, 17: but these last instances are somewhat uncertain.
This manuscript, with many others, was presented to the
University of Oxford in the year 1636, by its munificent
Chancellor, Archbishop Laud. Thomas Hearne, the celebrated
antiquary, published a full edition of it in 1715, which is now
very scarce, and was long known to be far from accurate.
Sabatier in 1751 gave the Latin of it taken from Hearne.
Tischendorf has published a new edition, from two separate
collations made by himself in 1854 and 1865, in the ninth
volume by way of Appendix to his <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita,”</span>
1870. It is also found in vol. ii of Hansell's edition of the
Ancient Texts, published at the Clarendon Press in 1864. Cod. E
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has been stated to have capital letters at the commencement of
each of the Euthalian sections, but as the capitals occur at other
places where the sense is broken but slightly (e.g. ch. xvii. 20),
this circumstance does not prove that those sections were known
to the scribe. It is in size 10-¼ inches by 8-½, and consists of 227
leaves of twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, or twenty-six
lines each; about fifteen leaves are lost: the vellum is rather
coarse in quality, and the ink in many places very faint. There
seem to be no stops nor breathings, except an aspirate over
initial <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">upsilon</span></span> ([symbol] or ὑ, sometimes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">υ</span></span> or υ [with diaresis]) almost invariably. The
shape of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">xi</span></span> is more complicated than usual (see our facsimile,
No. <a href="#Plate_X" class="tei tei-ref">25</a>); the other letters (e.g. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">psi</span></span>) are such as were
common in the sixth or early in the seventh century. There
are also many changes by a later uncial hand. Mr. Hansell
(Ancient Texts, Oxford, 1864), as well as Tischendorf, exhibits
one whole page in zinco-photography.

G. Tischendorf, in his eighth edition of the N. T., assigns

uncials without accents, torn from the wooden cover of a Syriac
book, and containing Acts ii. 45-iii. 8. It has a few rare and

Porphyry, who allowed him to take it to Leipsic to decipher.
He has published it at length in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta sacra inedita,”</span>

Tischendorf's fifth volume a neat facsimile of it in Acts iv. 10-15,
comprising uncials of the latest form, leaning to the right, lying
under cursive writing (Heb. vii. 17-25), some four centuries more
recent. Dr. Hort (Supplement to Tregelles, p. xxx) states that
in the Acts the text of Cod. P is almost exclusively of a very
late type, but that it contains a much larger though varying
proportion of various readings elsewhere, except in 1 Peter. The
upper or later writing in this manuscript is, for once, available
for critical purposes, since it consists of fragments of the labours
of Euthalius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg064" class="tei tei-ref">64</a>), and is cited by Tischendorf under the

Ephraemi in the same Library it has been fortunate in such
an editor as Tischendorf, who published it in 1852 with
complete Prolegomena, and a facsimile traced by Tregelles.
This noble volume is in small quarto, written on 533 leaves
of the thinnest and finest vellum: indeed its extraordinary
delicacy has caused the writing at the back of every page to be
rather too visible on the other side. The words, both Greek
and Latin, are written continuously (except the Latin titles and
subscriptions), but in a stichometrical form (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg052" class="tei tei-ref">52</a>): the Greek,
as in Cod. Bezae, stands on the left or first page of the opened
book, not on the right, as in the Cod. Laudianus. Each page has
but one column of about twenty-one lines, so that in this copy, as
in the Codex Bezae, the Greek and Latin are in parallel lines, but
on separate pages. The ink is dark and clear, and otherwise the
book is in good condition. It contains all St. Paul's Epistles
(the Hebrews after Philemon), except Rom. i. 1-7; 27-30, both
Greek and Latin: Rom. i. 24-27 in the Latin is supplied in
a later but very old hand, as also are Rom. i. 27-30 and 1 Cor.
xiv. 13-22 in the Greek: the Latin of 1 Cor. xiv. 8-18; Heb.
xiii. 21-23 is lost. The Epistle to the Hebrews has been
erroneously imputed by some to a later scribe, inasmuch as it is
not included in the list of the sacred books and in the number
of their στίχοι or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">versus</span></span>, which stand immediately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> the
Hebrews in this codex<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>: but the same list overlooks the Epistle
to the Philippians, which has never been doubted to be St.
Paul's: in this manuscript, however, the Epistle to the Colossians
precedes that to the Philippians. Our earliest notice of it is
derived from the Preface to Beza's third edition of the N. T.
(Feb. 20, 1582): he there describes it as of equal antiquity with
his copy of the Gospels (D), and states that it had been found
<span class="tei tei-q">“in Claromontano apud Bellovacos coenobio,”</span> at Clermont near
Beauvais. Although Beza sometimes through inadvertence calls
his codex of the Gospels Claromontanus, there seems no reason
for disputing with Wetstein the correctness of his account (see
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
p. <a href="#Pg125" class="tei tei-ref">125</a>, note 2), though it throws no light on the manuscript's
early history. From Beza it passed into the possession of Claude
Dupuy, Councillor of Paris, probably on Beza's death [1605]:
thence to his sons Jacques and Pierre Dupuy: before the death
of Jacques (who was the King's Librarian) in 1656, it had been
bought by Louis XIV for the Royal Library at Paris. In
1707, John Aymont, an apostate priest, stole thirty-five leaves;
one, which he disposed of in Holland, was restored in 1720 by
its possessor Stosch; the rest were sold to that great collector,
Harley, Earl of Oxford, but sent back in 1729 by his son, who
had learnt their shameful story. Beza made some, but not
a considerable, use of this document; it was amongst the
authorities consulted for Walton's Polyglott; Wetstein collated
it twice in early life (1715-16); Tregelles examined it in 1849,
and compared his results with the then unpublished transcript
of Tischendorf, which proved on its appearance (1852) the most
difficult, as well as one of the most important, of his critical
works; so hard it had been found at times to determine satisfactorily
the original readings of a manuscript which had been
corrected by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine</span></em> different hands, ancient and modern. The
date of the codex is doubtless the sixth century, in the middle
or towards the end of it. The Latin letters, especially <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>, are the
latest in form (facsimile No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">41</a>, 1 Cor. xiii. 5-8), and are much
like those in the Cod. Bezae (No. <a href="#Plate_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>), which in many points
Cod. Claromontanus strongly resembles. Leaves 162, 163 are
palimpsest, and contain part of the Phaethon, a lost play of
Euripides. We have already noticed many of its peculiarities
(pp. <a href="#Pg033" class="tei tei-ref">33-40</a>), and need not here repeat them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Delta</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>
look more ancient even than in Cod. A: the uncials are simple,
square, regular and beautiful, of about the size of those
in Codd. CD, and larger than in Cod. B. The stichometry
forbids our assigning it to a period earlier than the end of
the fifth century while other circumstances connected with
the Latin version tend to put it a little lower still. The
apostrophus is frequent, but there are few stops or abridgements;
no breathings or accents are <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>. Initial
letters, placed at the beginning of books or sections, are plain,
and not much larger than the rest. The comparative correctness
of the Greek text, and its Alexandrian forms, have caused certain
critics to refer us as usual to Egypt for its country: the Latin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
text is more faulty, and shows comparative ignorance of the
language: yet of what use a Latin version could be except in
Africa or western Europe it were hard to imagine. This Latin
is more independent of the Greek, and less altered from it than
in Codd. Bezae or Laudian., wherein it has little critical value:
that of Cod. Claromont. better represents the African type of
the Old Latin. Of the corrections, a few were made by the
original scribe when revising; a hand of the seventh century
went through the whole (D**); two others follow; then
in sharp black uncials of the ninth or tenth century another
made more than two thousand critical changes in the text,
and added stops and all the breathings and accents (D***);
another D**** (among other changes) added to the Latin subscriptions.
D<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">b</span></span> supplied Rom. i. 27-30 very early; D<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">c</span></span>, a later
hand, 1 Cor. xiv. 13-22. Tischendorf distinguishes several others
besides these.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
E. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Sangermanensis</span></span> is another Greek-Latin manuscript
and takes its name from the Abbey of St. Germain des Prez near
Paris. Towards the end of the last century the Abbey (which at
the Revolution had been turned into a saltpetre manufactory) was
burnt down, and many of its books were lost. In 1805 Matthaei
found this copy, as might almost have been anticipated, at
St. Petersburg, where it is now deposited. The volume is a large
quarto, the Latin and Greek in parallel columns on the same page,
the Greek standing on the left; its uncials are coarse, large, and
thick, not unlike those in Cod. E of the Acts, but of later shape,
with breathings and accents <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>, of about the tenth, or
late in the ninth, century<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>. It was used for the Oxford New
Testament of 1675: Mill obtained some extracts from it, and
noted its obvious connexion with Cod. Claromontanus: Wetstein
thoroughly collated it; and not only he but Sabatier and
Griesbach perceived that it was, at least in the Greek, nothing
better than a mere transcript of Cod. Claromontanus, made by
some ignorant person later than the corrector indicated by D****.
Muralt's endeavours to shake this conclusion have not satisfied
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
better judges; indeed the facts are too numerous and too plain to
be resisted. Thus, while in Rom. iv. 25 Cod. D reads δικαιωσιν
(accentuated δικαίωσιν by D***), in which D*** changes ν into
νην, the writer of Cod. E adopts δικαίωσινην with its monstrous
accent: in 1 Cor. xv. 5 Cod. D reads μετα ταυτα τοις ενδεκα, D***
εἶτα τοῖς δώδεκα (again observe the accents), out of which Cod. E
makes up μετα ταυεἶτα τοῖς δώενδεκα. In Gal. iv. 31 Cod. D has
διο, which is changed by D*** into ἆρα: Cod. E mixes up the
two into διἆραο. Compare Tischendorf's notes on Eph. ii. 19;
Heb. x. 17, 33, and Dr. Hort's longer specimen, Rom. xv. 31-3
(Introd. p. 254). The Latin version also is borrowed from Cod. D,
but is more mixed, and may be of some critical use: the Greek
is manifestly worthless, and should long since have been removed
from the list of authorities. This copy is defective, Rom. viii.
21-33; ix. 15-25; 1 Tim. i. 1-vi. 15; Heb. xii. 8-xiii. 25.

F. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Augiensis</span></span> in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge
(B. xvii. 1), is another Greek-Latin manuscript on 136
leaves of good vellum 4to (the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signatures</span></em> proving that seven
more are lost, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg028" class="tei tei-ref">28</a>), 9 inches by 7-¼, with the two languages
in parallel columns of twenty-eight lines on each page, the Greek
being always inside, the Latin next the edge of the book. It is
called from the monastery of Augia Dives or Major (Reichenau,
or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rich meadow</span></em>), on a fertile island in the lower part of Lake
Constance, to which it long appertained, and where it may even
have been written, a thousand years since. By notices at the
beginning and end we can trace it through the hands of G. M.
Wepfer of Schaffhausen and of L. Ch. Mieg, who covered many
of its pages with Latin notes wretchedly scrawled, but allowed
Wetstein to examine it. In 1718 Bentley was induced by
Wetstein to buy it at Heidelberg for 250 Dutch florins, and
both he and Wetstein collated the Greek portion, the latter
carelessly, but Bentley somewhat more fully in the margin of
a Greek Testament (Oxon. 1675) still preserved in Trinity
College (B. xvii. 8). Tischendorf in 1842, Tregelles in 1845,
re-examined the book (which had been placed where it now is
on the death of Bentley's nephew in 1787), and drew attention
to the Latin version: in 1859 Scrivener published an edition of
the Codex in common type, with Prolegomena and a photograph
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of one page (1 Tim. iii. 14-iv. 5)<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>.  The Epistles of St. Paul
are defective in Rom. i. 1-iii. 19; and the Greek only in 1 Cor.
iii. 8-16; vi. 7-14; Col. ii. 1-8; Philem. 21-25; in which four
places the Latin stands in its own column with no Greek over
against it. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Greek being
quite lost, the Latin occupies both columns: this Epistle alone
has an Argument, almost verbatim the same as we read in the
great Cod. Amiatinus of the Vulgate. At the end of the Epistle,
and on the same page (fol. 139, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">verso</span></span>), commences a kind of
Postscript (having little connexion with the sacred text), the
larger portion of which is met with under the title of Dicta
Abbatis Pinophi, in the works of Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop
of Mayence, who died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 856; from which circumstance
the Cod. Augiensis has been referred to the ninth century.
Palaeographical arguments also would lead us to the same
conclusion. The Latin version (a modification of the Vulgate
in its purest form, though somewhat tampered with in parts to
make it suit the Greek text<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a>) is written in the cursive minuscule
character common in the age of Charlemagne. The Greek
must have been taken from an archetype with the words continuously
written; for not only are they miserably ill divided
by the unlearned German<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> scribe, but his design (not always
acted upon) was to put a single middle point at the end of each
word. The Latin is exquisitely written, the Greek uncials are
neat, but evidently the work of an unpractised hand, which
soon changes from weariness. The shapes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pi</span></span>, and
other testing letters are such as we might have expected from
the date; some others have an older look.  Contrary to the
more ancient custom, capitals, small but numerous, occur in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">middle</span></span> of the lines in both languages. Of the ordinary breathings<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a>
and accents there are no traces.  Here and there we meet
with a straight line, inclined between the horizontal and the
acute accent, placed over an initial vowel, usually when it
should be aspirated, but not always (e.g. ίδιον 1 Cor. vi. 18).
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Over ι and υ double or single points, or a comma, are frequently
placed, especially if they begin a syllable; and occasionally
a large comma or kind of circumflex over ι, ει, and some other
vowels and diphthongs. The arrangement of the Greek forbids
punctuation there; in the Latin we find the single middle point
as a colon or after an abridgement, the semicolon (;) sometimes,
the note of interrogation (?) when needed. Besides the universal
forms of abridgement (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg049" class="tei tei-ref">49</a>), [symbol] and [symbol] are frequent in the
Greek, but no others: in the Latin the abbreviations are
numerous, and some of them unusual: Scrivener (Cod. Augiensis
Proleg. pp. xxxi-ii) has drawn up a list of them. This copy
abounds as much as any with real variations from the common
text, and with numberless errors of the pen, itacisms of vowels,
and permutations of consonants. It exhibits many corrections,
a few <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>, some unfortunately very recent, but by far
the greater number in a hand almost contemporary with the
manuscript, which has also inserted over the Greek, in 106 places,
Latin renderings differing from those in the parallel column, but
which in eighty-six of these 106 instances agree with the Latin
of the sister manuscript.

G. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cod. Boernerianus</span></span>, so called from a former possessor, but
now in the Royal Library at Dresden. In the sixteenth century
it belonged to Paul Junius of Leyden: it was bought dear at the
book-sale of Peter Francius, Professor at Amsterdam, in 1705,
by C. F. Boerner, a Professor at Leipsic, who lent it to Kuster
to enrich his edition of Mill (1710), and subsequently to Bentley.
The latter so earnestly wished to purchase it as a companion to
Cod. F, that though he received it in 1719, it could not be
recovered from him for five years, during which he was constantly
offering high sums for it<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a>: a copy, but not in Bentley's hand, had
been already made (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 2). Cod. G was published
in full by Matthaei in 1791, in common type, with two facsimile
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pages (1 Cor. ii. 9-iii. 3; 1 Tim. i. 1-10), and his edition is
believed to be very accurate; Anger, Tischendorf, Tregelles,
Böttiger and others who have examined it have only expressly
indicated three errors<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>. Rettig has abundantly proved that, as
it is exactly of the same size, so it once formed part of the same
volume with Cod. Δ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg157" class="tei tei-ref">157</a> and note): they must date towards
the end of the ninth century, and may very possibly have been
written in the monastery of St. Gall (where Δ still remains) by
some of the Irish monks who flocked to those parts. That Cod.
G has been in such hands appears from some very curious Irish
lines at the foot of one of Matthaei's plates (fol. 23), which, after
having long perplexed learned men, have at length been translated
for Dr. Reeves, the eminent Celtic scholar<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a>. All that we have
said respecting the form of Cod. Δ applies to this portion of it:
the Latin version (a specimen of the Old Latin, but as in Codd.
Bezae and Laudianus much changed to suit the Greek) is cursive
and interlinear; the Greek uncials coarse and peculiar; the
punctuation chiefly a stop at the end of the words, which have
no breathings nor accents. Its affinity to the Cod. Augiensis has
no parallel in this branch of literature. Scrivener has noted all
the differences between them at the foot of each page in his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
edition of Cod. F: they amount to but 1,982 places, whereof 578
are mere blunders of the scribe, 967 changes of vowels or itacisms,
166 interchanges of consonants, seventy-one grammatical or orthographical
forms; the remaining 200 are real various readings,
thirty-two of them relating to the article. While in Cod. F
(whose first seven leaves are lost) the text commences at Rom.
iii. 19, μω; λεγει, this portion is found complete in Cod. G, except
Rom. i. 1-5; ii. 16-25. All the other lacunae of Cod. F occur
also in Cod. G, which ends at Philem. 20 ἐν <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">χρω</span></span>: there is no
Latin version to supply these gaps in Cod. G, but a blank space
is always left, sufficient to contain what is missing. At the end
of Philemon G writes (ad) Προς (laudicenses) λαουδακησασ<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> (incipit) αρχεται (epistola) επιστολη, but
neither that writing nor the Epistle to the Hebrews follows. It
seems tolerably plain that one of these manuscripts was not
copied immediately from the other, for while they often accord
even in the strangest errors of the pen that men unskilled in
Greek could fall into, their division of the Greek words, though
equally false and absurd, is often quite different: it results
therefore that they are independent transcripts of the same
venerable archetype (probably stichometrical and some centuries
older than themselves) which was written without any
division between the words<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>. From the form of the letters
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and other circumstances Cod. F may be deemed somewhat but
not much the older; its corrector <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">secundâ manu</span></span> evidently had
both the Greek and the Latin of Cod. G before him, and Rabanus,
in whose works the Dicta Pinophi are preserved (p. 178), was
the great antagonist of Godeschalk, on whom the annotator of
Codd. ΔG bears so hard. Cod. G is in 4to, of ninety-nine leaves,
with twenty-one lines in each. The line indicating breathing (if
such be its use, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg178" class="tei tei-ref">178</a>) and the mark &gt; employed to fill up
spaces (p. <a href="#Pg051" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>), more frequent in it than in F.

Since Dr. Scrivener wrote the above, a very valuable little
treatise—a <span class="tei tei-q">“specimen primum”</span>—has been given to the learned
world by Herr P. Corssen<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>, and a most clear and carefully
argued paper has been sent to the editor by the Rev. Nicholas
Pocock of Clifton. Both Herr Corssen and Mr. Pocock agree in
showing that F was not derived from G, nor G from F, but that
they come from the same original. Both agree, again, that the
Greek version is derived, at least in large measure, from the
Latin, as in such instances as the following, which are supplied
by Mr. Pocock, who holds, and appears to prove, that F and
G were copied from an interlinear manuscript: <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ut sciatis</span></span>, ινα
οιδαται (F, G), 1 Thess. iii. 3; <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sicut cancer ut serpat</span></span>, ως γαγγρα,
ινα νομηνεξει (G), 2 Tim. ii. 17, F having the same reading, only
dividing the last word; Gal. iv. 3 <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">eramus autem servientes</span></span>, ημεθα
δε δουλωμενοι (F, G). Herr Corssen considers that a Latin was
the scribe of the original, that it was written in Italy, and that
it was better than the Claromontanus (D), to which it had
affinities, this last having an amended text with corrections from
the Greek. The original of all three he supposes to date from
not before the fifth century. But in some of these last suppositions
we are getting upon the ocean of conjecture.

retouched this copy (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Silvestre, Paléographie Universelle,

authorities for stichometrical writing, were used in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1218
to bind some other manuscripts on Mount Athos, and thence
came into the library of Coislin, Bishop of Metz. Montfaucon
has published Cod. H in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Bibliotheca Coisliniana,”</span> but
Tischendorf, who transcribed it, projected a fuller and more
accurate edition. He observed at Paris in 1865 an additional
passage, 2 Cor. iv. 4-6 (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. ix. p. xiv, note),
and cites Cod. H in his eighth edition on 1 Tim. vi. 19; Heb. x.
1-6; 34-38. The subscriptions, which appear due to Euthalius

have neither breathings nor accents. Besides arguments
to the Epistles, we copy the following final subscription from
Tischendorf (N. T. 1859, p. clxxxix): ἔγραψα καὶ ἐξεθέμην κατὰ

conclude with Dr. Field (Proleg. in Hexapla Origenis, p. xcix)
that the noble Library at Caesarea was still safe in the sixth
century, though it may have perished <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 638, when that city

has since found one leaf more. Henke in 1800 edited the
Hamburg portion, Tregelles collated it twice, and Tischendorf in
1855 published the text of both in full in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Anecdota Sacra

five mistakes in his printed text. The letters are a little
unusual in form, perhaps about the tenth century in date; but
though sometimes joined in the same word, can hardly be called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">semicursive</span></em>. Our facsimile (Plate <a href="#Plate_XII" class="tei tei-ref">xii</a>, No. 34) is from the

of about the same age, added to the venerable Leyden Octateuch,
on a page published in facsimile by Tischendorf (Monum. sacr.

and constantly: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">iota</span></span> ascript occurs three times (2 Cor. i.

(as it is called) is rare. The usual stop is the single point in its
three positions, with a change in power, as in Cod. E of the
Gospels. The interrogative (;) occurs once (Heb. iii. 17), and &gt;
is often repeated to fill up space, or, in a smaller size, to
mark quotations. After the name of each of the Epistles
(2 Cor. and Heb.) in their titles we read εκτεθεισα ὡς εν
πινακι, which Tischendorf thus explains; that whereas it was
customary to prefix an argument to each Epistle, these words,
originally employed to introduce the argument, were retained
even when the argument was omitted. Henke's account of the
expression looks a little less forced, that this manuscript was set
forth ὡς εν πινακι, that is, in vermilion, after the pattern of
Imperial letters patent.

century, and the volume also contains in the same hand
Homilies of Basil the Great and of Gregory of Nyssa, &amp;c. It
was first known from a notice (by Vitali) and facsimile in Bianchini's
Evangeliarium Quadruplex (1749), part i. vol. ii. p. 524
(facs. p. 505, tab. iv): Wetstein was promised a collation of it
by Cardinal Quirini, who seems to have met with unexpected
hindrances, as the papers only arrived after the text of the New
Testament was printed, and then proved very loose and defective.
When Tischendorf was at Rome in 1843, though forbidden
to collate it afresh (in consequence, as we now know, of its
having been already printed in Mai's then unpublished volumes
of the Codex Vaticanus), he was permitted to make a facsimile
of a few verses, and while thus employed he so far contrived to
elude the watchful custodian, as to compare the whole manuscript
with a modern Greek Testament. The result was given in his
Monumenta sacra inedita (1846), pp. 407-432, with a good
facsimile; but (as was natural under the unpromising circumstances—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">arrepta
potius quam lecta</span></span>”</span> is his own confession)
Tregelles in 1845 was able to observe several points which he
had overlooked, and more have come to light since Mai's edition
has appeared. In 1866, however, Tischendorf was allowed to
transcribe this document at leisure, and re-published it in full in
his Appendix N. T. Vaticani, 1869, pp. 1-20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This Codex is now known to contain the whole of the Apocalypse,
a fact which the poor collation that Wetstein managed to
procure had rendered doubtful. It is rather an octavo than
a folio or quarto; the uncials being of a peculiar kind, simple
and unornamented, leaning a little to the right (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg041" class="tei tei-ref">41</a>, note):
they hold a sort of middle place between square and oblong
characters. The shape of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">beta</span></span> is peculiar, the two loops to the
right nowhere touching each other, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">psi</span></span> has degenerated into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the form of a cross (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Plate <a href="#Plate_III" class="tei tei-ref">iii</a>, No. 7): <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">delta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">theta</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">xi</span></span> are also
of the latest uncial fashion. The breathings and accents are
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ manu</span></span>, and pretty correct; the rule of the grammarians
respecting the change of power of the single point in punctuation
according to its change of position is now regularly
observed. The scarcity of old copies of the Apocalypse renders
this uncial of some importance, and it often confirms the readings
of the older codices אAC, though on the whole it resembles
them considerably less than does Cod. P, and agrees in preference
with the later or more ordinary cursives.

Among the illuminations were what have been said to be pictures
of the Emperor Leo the Wise [886-911] and his son Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, but all the beautiful miniatures were stolen prior
to 1860-2, except one before St. John's Gospel. Its later history
is the same as that of Cod. E of the Gospels: it was known to
Erasmus; it was borrowed by Reuchlin, a few extracts given by Bengel

(Bas. γ), collated by Wetstein, and recently in the Gospels by C. L. Roth
and Tregelles, who have compared their results. Our facsimile (No. <a href="#Plate_IX" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>)
gives an excellent notion of the elegant and minute style of writing,
which is fully furnished with breathings, accents, and ι ascript. The
initial letters are gilt, and on the first page of each Gospel the full point
is a large gilt ball. In the Gospels the text adheres frequently to the
uncials Codd. אB, BL and such cursives as 118, 131, and especially 209

In text it resembles Codd. BDL more than any other cursive manuscript.
After Larroque, Wetstein, Griesbach, Begtrup, and Scholz, it was
most laboriously collated by Tregelles in 1850. There are fifty-two
long lines in each page, in a fine round hand, the accents being
sometimes neglected, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eta</span></span> unusually like our English letter h.
The ends of the leaves are much damaged, and greatly misplaced
by the binder; so that the Gospels now stand last, though on
comparing the style of handwriting (which undergoes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gradual</span></em> change
throughout the volume) at their beginning and end with that in the
Prophets which stand first, and that in the Epistles which should follow
them, it is plain that they originally occupied their usual place. The ink
too, by reason of the damp, has often left its proper page blank, so that
the writing can only be read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">set off</span></em> on the opposite page, especially
in the Acts. Hence it is no wonder that Tregelles should say that of all
the manuscripts he has collated <span class="tei tei-q">“none has ever been so wearisome to the
eyes, and exhaustive of every faculty of attention.”</span> (Account of the
Printed Text, p. 162.)

42. Cod. Medicaeus exhibits many readings of the same class as
Codd. 1, 13, 33, but its authority has the less weight, since it has disappeared
under circumstances somewhat suspicious. Edward Bernard
communicated to Mill these readings, which he had found in the hand of
Peter Pithaeus, a former owner, in the margin of Stephen's N. T. of
1550: they professed to be extracted from an <span class="tei tei-q">“exemplar Regium

Library which Catherine de' Medici brought to France: above, p. <a href="#Pg117" class="tei tei-ref">117</a>,

Dr. Orlando Dobbin (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> on Cod. 58), has discussed in his Introduction
every point of interest connected with it. It contains the whole New
Testament, apparently the work of three or four successive scribes, paper
leaves, only one of them—that on which 1 John v. 7 stands—being glazed<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a>,

as if to protect it from harm. This manuscript was first heard of between
the publication of Erasmus' second (1519) and third (1522) editions of
his N. T., and after he had publicly declared, in answer to objectors, that
if any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></em> manuscript could be found containing the passage, he would
insert it in his revision of the text; a promise which he fulfilled in 1522.
Erasmus describes his authority as <span class="tei tei-q">“Codex Britannicus,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“apud Anglos
repertus,”</span> and there is the fullest reason to believe that the Cod. Montfortianus
is the copy referred to (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> Vol. II. Chap. XI). Its earliest known
owner was Froy<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>, a Franciscan friar, then Thomas Clement [fl. 1569],
then William Chark [fl. 1582], then Thomas Montfort, D.D. of Cambridge,
from whom it derives its name, then Archbishop Ussher, who caused the
collation to be made which appears in Walton's Polyglott (Matt. i. 1-Acts
xxii. 29; Rom. i), and presented the manuscript to Trinity
College. Dr. Barrett appended to his edition of Cod. Z a full collation
of the parts left untouched by his predecessors; but since the work of
Ussher's friends was known to be very defective, Dobbin has re-collated
the whole of that portion which Barrett left unexamined, comparing the
readings throughout with Codd. 56, 58 of the Gospels, and Cod. 33 of the
Acts. This copy has <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prol.</span></span>, κεφ. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t.</span></span>, κεφ., τίτλ., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Am.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eus.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">subscr.</span></span>, στίχ.,
besides which the division by the Latin chapters in St. Mark is employed,
a sure proof—if any were needed—of the modern date of the manuscript.
There are many corrections by a more recent hand, erasures by the
pen, &amp;c. It has been supposed that the Gospels were first written; then
the Acts and Epistles (transcribed, in Dobbin's judgement, from Cod.
33, Acts); the Apocalypse last; having been added about 1580, as
Tregelles and Dr. Dobbin think, from Cod. 69, when they were both
in Chark's possession. The text, however, of the Apocalypse is not quite
the same in the two codices, nor would it be easy, without seeing them
together, to verify Dobbin's conjecture, that the titles to the sacred
books, in pale red ink, were added by the same person in both manuscripts.
In the margin of this copy, as of Cod. 69, are inserted many
readings in Chark's handwriting, even the misprint of Erasmus, ἐμαῖς for
ἐν αἷς, Apoc. ii. 13.

64. Bute, formerly Ussher 2. This MS. belonged, like the preceding,
to the illustrious Primate of Ireland, but has been missing from Trin.
Coll. Library in Dublin ever since 1742, or, as Dr. C. R. Gregory thinks
on the authority of Dr. T. K. Abbott, 1702. It was collated, like Cod.
63, by Dodwell for Fell, by Bulkeley for Mill. It once belonged to Dr.
Thomas Goad, and was very neatly, though incorrectly, written in octavo.
As the Emmanuel College copy of the Epistles (Act. 53, Paul. 30) never
contained the Gospels, for which it is perpetually cited in Walton's
Polyglott as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Em.</span></span>, the strong resemblance subsisting between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Usser.</span></span> 2 and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Em.</span></span> led Mill to suspect that they were in fact the same copy. The result
of an examination of Walton's with Mill's collations is that they are in
numberless instances cited together in support of readings, in company
with other manuscripts; often with a very few or even alone (e.g. Matt.
vi. 22; viii. 11; xii. 41; Mark ii. 2; iv. 1; ix. 10; 25; Luke iv. 32;
viii. 27; John i. 21; iv. 24; v. 7; 20; 36; vii. 10; xvi. 19; xxi. 1).
That <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Usser.</span></span> 2 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Em.</span></span> are sometimes alleged separately is easily
accounted for by the inveterate want of accuracy exhibited by all early
collators. But all doubt is at an end since Dean Burgon in 1880 found
this celebrated copy in the library of the Marquis of Bute, and has traced
the curious history of its rovings. From Dr. Goad (d. 1638) it came into
the keeping of Primate Ussher, by whose hand the modern chapters seem to
have been written in the margin. Then towards the end of the seventeenth
century (as his signature proves) it belonged to one John Jones: a later
hand puts in the date Saturday, May 25, 1728. It has also the book
plate of John Earl of Moira (d. 1793). Then we trace it to James
Verschoyle, afterwards Bishop of Killala from 1793 to 1834, thence to
the Earls of Huntingdon for two generations, when it was purchased at
the Donnington Park sale by Lord Bute. Without doubt this is the
long lost Cod. 64, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Usser.</span></span> 2 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Em.</span></span> of Mill: it was recognized
at once by the reading in John viii. 8. Dean Burgon describes it
as [xii or xiii] now in two volumes, bound in red morocco about
150 years since. It has 440 leaves, 4-3/5 inches by 3-2/5 in size. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carp.</span></span>,

the William Chark, mentioned under Cod. 61 (p. <a href="#Pg201" class="tei tei-ref">201</a>) who got it from
Brynkley, who probably got it like the Caius MS. (Evan. 59) from the
Convent of Grey Friars at Cambridge. In 1641 (Wetstein states 1669)
Thomas Hayne, M.A., of Trussington, in that county, gave this MS. with
his other books to the Leicester Library. Mill was permitted to use it at
Oxford, and collated it there in 1671. A collation also made by John
Jackson and William Tiffin was lent to Wetstein through Caesar de
Missy and Th. Gee, a Presbyterian minister of But Close, Leicester.
Tregelles re-collated it in 1852 for his edition of the Greek Testament,
and Scrivener very minutely in 1855; the latter published his
results, with a full description of the book itself, in the Appendix to his
<span class="tei tei-q">“Codex Augiensis.”</span> No manuscript of its age has a text so remarkable
as this, less however in the Acts than in the Gospels. Though none of
the ordinary divisions into sections, and scarcely any liturgical marks,
occur throughout, there is evidently a close connexion between Cod. 69
and the Church Service-books, as well in the interpolations of proper
names, particles of time, or whole passages (e.g. Luke xxii. 43, 44
placed after Matt. xxvi. 39) which are common to both, as especially in
the titles of the Gospels: ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ μάρκον εὐαγγέλιον (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>), &amp;c., being in
the very language of the Lectionaries<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>. Codd. 178, 443 have the same
peculiarity. Tables of κεφάλαια stand before the three later Gospels,
with very unusual variations; for which, as well as for the foreign
matter inserted and other peculiarities of Cod. 69, consult Scrivener's
Cod. Augiensis (Introd. pp. xl-xlvii). See also Mr. J. Rendel Harris,

102. Bibliothecae Medicae, an unknown manuscript with many rare
readings, extracted by Wetstein at Amsterdam for Matt. xxiv-Mark
viii. 1, from the margin of a copy of Plantin's N. T. 1591, in the library
of J. Le Long. Canon Westcott is convinced that the manuscript from
which these readings were derived is none other than Cod. B itself, and
Dr. Gregory agrees with him. In St. Matthew's Gospel he finds the two
authorities agree seventy times and differ only five times, always in
a manner to be easily accounted for: in St. Mark they agree in eighty-four
out of the eighty-five citations, the remaining one (ch. ii. 22)
being hardly an exception. Westcott, New Test., Smith's <span class="tei tei-q">“Dictionary

finds Reg. 196 to be a copy of Theophylact's commentary on SS. Matthew

Out of this whole mass of 190 manuscripts, Scholz collated five entire
(262, 299, 300, 301, 346), eleven in the greater part (260, 270, 271,
277, 284, 285, 298, 324, 353, 382, 428), many in a few places, and not
a few seem to have been left by him untouched. His list of Oriental
manuscripts (Evann. 450-469), as it is given in the first volume of his
Greek Testament (Proleg. pp. xcvi-xcvii)<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a>, has been withdrawn from the
catalogue of cursive copies of the Gospels, in deference to the wish of the
Dean of Chichester (Letter iii addressed to myself in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span> newspaper,
July 5, 1882). It must be confessed indeed that Scholz's account
of what he had seen in the East about 1823 cannot be easily reconciled
with the description of the Rev. H. O. Coxe of the Bodleian Library
thirty-five years later (<span class="tei tei-q">“Report to Her Majesty's Government of the
Greek Manuscripts yet remaining in the Libraries of the Levant, 1858”</span>);
that most of the books which Scholz catalogued at St. Saba on the Dead
Sea were removed before 1875, as Mr. F. W. Pennefather informs us, to
the Great Greek Convent of the Cross at Jerusalem; and that at least
four of them were brought to Parham in Sussex from St. Saba in 1834 by
the late Lord de la Zouche. Instead of Scholz's seven (450-6), Coxe saw
fourteen copies of the Gospels at Jerusalem; twenty of the Gospels
(besides a noble palimpsest of the Orestes and Phoenissae) at St. Saba
after the four had been subtracted, instead of Scholz's ten (457-466); at
Patmos five instead of Scholz's three (467-469). In spite of one's
respect for the memory of that zealous and worthy labourer, M. A. Scholz,
with whom I had a personal conference regarding our common studies in
1845, I cannot help acquiescing in Dean Burgon's decision, though not,
perhaps, without some natural reluctance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have already intimated that Tischendorf has chosen to
make no addition to the numerical list of cursive manuscripts
furnished by Scholz, preferring to indicate the fresh
materials which have since come to light by another notation,
derived from the names of the collators or the places where they
are deposited. As this plan has proved in practice very inconvenient,
it is no wonder that Dean Burgon, after casting away
Scholz's numbers from 450 to 469, on account of their evident
inaccuracy, which has since then received definite proof, should
have assigned numerals to the cursives unknown to Scholz from
450 to 737, still excluding, as far as was then possible, those
whose location or character was uncertain. Burgon's method, as
laid down in his Letters in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span> for July 5, 12, 19, 26,
1882, having the priority of publication, and being arranged with
regard to the places where the manuscripts are deposited rather
than to their actual collators, may as well be adopted as any other
that might be made. The only important point to be secured is
that all scholars should employ the SAME NUMBERS when
speaking of the SAME MANUSCRIPTS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is greatly to be regretted that Dr. C. R. Gregory, even upon
advice tendered by other critics, if such was the case, should
have neglected the important principle laid down in the preceding
sentence, and in Part II of his very valuable Prolegomena
to Tischendorf's eighth edition, published seven years after the
third edition of this work, should have helped to make confusion
worse confounded in this large and increasing field. But it is
not my object to assail one who has done this study very great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
service, but only to point out an inconvenience which I shall
endeavour to minimize as far as I can. It is clear that Dr.
Scrivener's order, being the first out, and having been followed
since then in quotations in books, and notably by the late
learned Abbé Martin, cannot be allowed to drop. I have therefore
followed it in the succeeding pages. But it has been my
object to bring together the two lists as soon as possible after the
close of Dr. Scrivener's, and the end of the supplementary lists
of Dean Burgon and the Abbé Martin, and to follow, as far as the
case will admit, the lead of Dr. Gregory, where he has every
right to prescribe the series of numbers. Unfortunately, this
course is not always open, because when the time has arrived it
is found that some MSS. have been already forestalled, and
others are in arrear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should be added, that the number of the MSS. as standing
in Dr. Gregory's list, where it varies from the present, is given
at the end of the account of each manuscript; and reversely
a table is added at the end of this volume of the varying numbers
in this list which answer to the numbers in Dr. Gregory's list.

contains the Gospels, Acts, Catholic Epistles, Romans, 1, 2 Corinthians,
Galatians, the rest of the original volume being evidently torn out
of the book when already bound. In the same year 1871 the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts also imported from Janina in Epirus sixty-seven leaves
containing the rest of St. Paul's Epistles and the Apocalypse (B.-C.
II. 4, Paul. 266, Apoc. 89), which fragments were described in the
second edition of the present book. Mr. Edward A. Guy, of Miami
University, Oxford, Ohio, U.S.A., on examining the Museum fragment
in 1875 with my book in his hand, concluded that the two portions
originally formed one magnificent copy of the whole New Testament,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

was worked off through damp on the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">verso</span></span> of the last leaf (302)
of the Museum copy, and the red κεφ. of Gal. vi on the top of

The Rev. H. O. Coxe, late Bodley's Librarian, though quite unable to
purchase any of the literary treasures he was commissioned to inspect in
1857, added considerably by his research to our knowledge of manuscripts
in the East. A list of them was given in groups by Dr. Scrivener in the
third edition of this work: but for various reasons they will be found
separately placed amongst the ensuing MSS., to fill up gaps which have
been since discovered in the supplementary list of cursive manuscripts
that was bound up in the beginning of the last edition.

The Evann. 622-735 were reported to Dean Burgon from several
Libraries in reply to his sedulous enquiries. Upon subsequent examination
by Dr. C. R. Gregory on the spot, many of them were seen not to be
Evangelia, but instead of that commentaries of St. Chrysostom, or other
commentaries, or Evangelistaria, or MSS. containing other matter. Thus—including
the list of the Abbé Martin, who extended Dean Burgon's
numeration up to 776—the following must be excised: 643-665, 667,
673, 677-679, 681, 682, 685, 686, 688, 689, 695, 700-702, 706, 711,
712, 715-722, 724-728 (including 726 which Dr. Scrivener noticed as
a duplication of 611), 731, 733, 734, 758, 760, 763, 771, 772, 775, 776.

Coxe in his travels, and enumerated in his Report to Her Majesty's

We have now come to Dr. Gregory's list, where Dr. Scrivener's
and the Abbé Martin's have ceased, and shall follow it,
except in the case of MSS. which have been already recorded,
and which therefore must be replaced by other MSS. Whenever
no independent information is at hand, the MS. will be
simply noted, and the reader is referred to Dr. Gregory's <span class="tei tei-q">“Prolegomena”</span>
under the same number. Information from other
sources than Dr. Gregory's book will in each case, where the
Editor has discovered it, be duly given. Whenever no reference
is made to Dr. Gregory's list, the numbers in both lists are the
same.

The particulars added to MSS. at Athens are taken from the
Catalogue by K. Alcibiades I. Sakkelion, obligingly lent me
with others by Mr. J. Rendel Harris; but the press-marks of the
MSS. have apparently been changed since Dr. Gregory examined
them, and I have not succeeded in obtaining information upon
this point. I have therefore identified the MSS. as best I could,
and have inserted queries when there seemed to be doubt. The
number in brackets is the present press-mark. The two measurements
often differ; I have followed that of Sakkelion.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Handschriftliche Funde”</span> (1861). Tregelles also, in the second part
of the same work, published an independent collation of his own (with
valuable 'Notes' prefixed), which he had made at Erlangen in 1862.
The identity of Apoc. 1 with the recovered copy is manifest from such
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">monstra</span></span> as ἐβάπτισας ch. ii. 3, which is found in both; from the reading
συνάγει ch. xiii. 10, and from the clauses put wrong by Erasmus, as
being lost in the commentary, e.g. ch. ii. 17; iii. 5, 12, 15; vi. 11, 15.
Of this copy Dr. Hort says (Introd. p. 263) that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is by no means an
average cursive of the common sort. On the one hand it has many
individualisms and readings with small and evidently unimportant attestation:
on the other it has a large and good ancient element,... and
ought certainly (with the somewhat similar 38) to stand high among
secondary documents.”</span>

Gospels.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However grievously the great mass of cursive manuscripts
of the New Testament has been neglected by Biblical
critics, the Lectionaries of the Greek Church, partly for causes
previously stated, have received even less attention at their
hands. Yet no sound reason can be alleged for regarding the
testimony of these Service-books as of slighter value than that
of other witnesses of the same date and character. The necessary
changes interpolated in the text at the commencement and
sometimes at the end of lessons are so simple and obvious that
the least experienced student can make allowance for them<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>:
and if the same passage is often given in a different form when
repeated in the same Lectionary, although the fact ought to be
recorded and borne in mind, this occasional inconsistency must
no more militate against the reception of the general evidence of
the copy that exhibits it, than it excludes from our roll of critical
authorities the works of Origen and other Fathers, in which the
selfsame variation is even more the rule than the exception.
Dividing, therefore, the Lectionaries that have been hitherto
catalogued (which form indeed but a small portion of those
known to exist in Eastern monasteries and Western libraries)
into Evangelistaria, or Evangeliaria, containing extracts from
the Gospels, and Praxapostoli or Apostoli comprising extracts
from the Acts and Epistles; we purpose to mark with an asterisk
the few that have been really collated, including them in the
same list with the majority which have been examined superficially,
or not at all. Uncial copies (some as late as the eleventh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
century) will be distinguished by [+]. The uncial codices of the
Gospels amount to one hundred and six, those of the Acts and
Epistles only to seven or eight, but probably to more in either
case, since all is not known about some of the Codd. recorded
here. Lectionaries are usually (yet see below, Evst. 111, 142,
178, 244, 249, 255, 256, 262, 266, 268, 275, Apost. 52, 69) written

Evst. 265, 269, 271 sometimes agree with each other in departing
from the ordinary week-day Church Lessons, and suggest, as Dean
Burgon observes, some local fashion which is well worth investigating for
textual purposes. The student will have noticed, in our Table of Lessons
appended to Chap. III, how often two other codices, Apost. 64, or
B.-C. III. 24 and Evst. 253, or B.-C. III. 42, depart from the common
use of Church Lesson books, but only for the middle days of the week:
not, it would seem, for Saturdays and Sundays.

MSS., which have been first recorded by Dr. Gregory, I have
only mentioned them, with a general reference to Dr. Gregory's book,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the application of photography in its more perfect forms to
manuscripts for the purpose of representing their character accurately to
scholars who have no opportunity of examining the manuscripts for themselves,
the older facsimiles have in greater measure lost their value. It
seems, therefore, hardly worth while to refer to the collections of facsimiles
made by Montfaucon, or Bianchini, or Silvestre, or Westwood,
other representations when they are to be had being so much more
faithful and instructive.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some account of the old way of dating Greek MSS. by indiction has
been already given (p. <a href="#Pg042" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>, n. 2), but it may be convenient to our readers
to have a fuller description to refer to. Such a description may be found
in Mr. Maunde Thompson's admirable Manual on Greek and Latin
Palaeography, pp. 322-3, which, by the kind permission of the author,
is reproduced here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mediaeval Greek MSS. are dated sometimes by the year of the

<span class="tei tei-q">“The Indiction was a cycle of fifteen years, which are severally styled
Indiction 1, Indiction 2, &amp;c., up to Indiction 15, when the series begins
afresh. The introduction of this system is attributed to Constantine the
Great. From the circumstance of the commencement of the indiction
being reckoned variously from different days, four kinds of indictions have
been recognized, viz.:—</span>

remains, the indiction will be 15; if there is a remainder, it will be the
number of the indiction. But it must not be forgotten that the Indiction
of Constantinople begins on the first of September, and consequently that
the last four months of a year of the Christian era belong to the next
indiction year.</span>

The following ingenious and probably sound explanation of what has
been long a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crux</span></em> to Textual Critics, comes from a Lecture by Mr. Rendel
Harris, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Origin of the Ferrar Group,”</span> delivered at Mansfield
College, Oxford, on Nov. 6, 1893, and since published (C. J. Clay and
Sons), and courteously sent to the editor by the accomplished author.
The explanation is given in Mr. Harris' own words (pp. 7-10): but the
whole of his pamphlet should be consulted by those who are interested in
this study.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In Scrivener's Introduction to the New Testament (ed. 3, p. 65) we
are told that <span class="tei tei-q">‘besides the division of the text into στίχοι or lines, we find
in the Gospels alone another division into ῥήματα or ῥήσεις, <span class="tei tei-q">“sentences,”</span>
differing but little from the στίχοι in number. Of these last the precise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
numbers vary in different copies, though not considerably, &amp;c.’</span> And on
p. 66 we find the following statistical statement:</span>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Matthew has 2522 ῥήματα</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

frequently find the attestation given both of the ῥήματα and the στίχοι:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No explanation, as far as I know, has ever been given of these curiously
numbered ῥήματα. The word is, certainly, a peculiar one to use, if short
sentences are intended, such as are commonly known by the terms <span class="tei tei-q">‘cola
and commata.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It has occurred to me that perhaps the explanation might lie in the
fact that ῥῆμα was here a literal translation of the Syriac word
ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ).
Let us then see whether ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ) is the proper word to describe a verse,
either a fixed verse, like a hexameter, or a sense-line. A reference to
Payne Smith's Lexicon will show that it may be used in either of these
senses, for example, we are told that it is not only used generally of the
verses of Scripture, but that it may stand for <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">comma, membrum versus,
sententia brevior quam versus,</span></span> στίχος, Schol. ad Hex. Job. ix. 33;
ܦܬܓܡܐ ܡܒ (or ܒܡ ܐܡܓܬܦ), Tit. ib. Ps. ix; ܦܬܓܡܐ  ܐܠܦܐܒ (or ܒܐܦܠܐ ܐܡܓܬܦ). Ex. xxx. 22
marg.: insunt in Geneseos libro ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">mmmmdix</span></span>, coloph. ad Gen., it.
C.S.B. 2 et sic ad fin. cuiusque libri; in libris poeticis sententia est
hemistichio minor, e.g. in Ps. i. insunt versus sex sed ܦܬ ܞܕ (or ܕܞ ܬܦ); in
Ps. ii. versus duodecim, sed ܦܬ ܠܚ (or ܚܠ ܬܦ).’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It seems, therefore, to be used in Syriac much in the same way as
στίχος in Greek.</span>

we see at a glance that we are dealing with the same system; Luke

reckoning, 38 and 97 verses respectively, and similarly in other cases.

Unconscious or unintentional errors, (1) of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sight</span></em>; (2) of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hearing</span></em>; (3) of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em>:
and those that are Conscious or intentional, viz. (4) incorporation of marginal
glosses; (5) corrections of harsh or unusual forms of words, or expressions;
(6) alterations in the text to produce supposed harmony with another passage,
to complete a quotation, or to clear up a presumed difficulty; (7) Liturgical
insertions. While he enumerates (8) alterations for dogmatic reasons, he adds
that <span class="tei tei-q">“there appears to be no strong ground for the suggestion”</span> that any such
exist (Hammond, p. 17). Professor Roberts (<span class="tei tei-q">“Words of the New Testament”</span>

the same as the Ashburnham manuscript below, seen by him at Lyons in 1843; in

reluctance of scribes to begin a new line with any combination of letters which
could not commence a Greek word, and to end a line with any letter which is
not a vowel, or a liquid, or σ, or γ before another consonant, except in the case
of Proper Names (Journal of Sacred Literature, April 1863, p. 8). Certainly
the general practice in Cod. א bears out the rule thus laid down, though a few
instances to the contrary occur here and there (Scrivener, Collation of Cod.

Dean of Derry and Raphoe.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
i. It is demonstrable that the Eusebian Sections and Canons on the margin
are contemporaneous with the text. For they are wanting from leaves 10 and
15. Now these leaves are conjugate; and they have been (on other grounds)
noted by Tischendorf as written not by the scribe of the body of the N. T., but by
one of his colleagues (<span class="tei tei-q">“D”</span>) who wrote part of the O. T. and acted as Diorthota
of the N. T. It thus appears that, after the marginal numbers had been
inserted, the sheet containing leaves 10 and 15 was cancelled, and rewritten by
a contemporary hand. The numbers must therefore have been written before
the MS. was completed and issued.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
ii. The exemplar whence these numbers were derived, differed considerably
from that which the text follows. For, in some cases, the sectional numbers
indicate the presence of passages which are absent from the text. E.g. St. Matt.
xvi. 2, 3, which is sect. 162, is wanting; and 162 is assigned to ver. 4, while the
wrong canon (5 for 6) betrays the presence in the canonizer's exemplar of the
passage omitted by the scribe. The same is true of St. Mark xv. 28 (in which case
the scribe is <span class="tei tei-q">“D”</span>).
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
iii. The scribe who wrote the text was unacquainted with the Eusebian sections.
For the beginning of a section is not marked, as in A and most subsequent MSS.,
by a division of the text and a larger letter. On the contrary the text is divided
into paragraphs quite independent of the Eusebian divisions, which often begin
in the middle of a line, and are marked merely by two dots (:) in vermilion,
inserted no doubt by the rubricator as he entered the numbers in the margin.
The fact that the numbers of the sections as well as of the canons (not as in
other MSS. of the Canons only) are in vermilion, points the same way.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
iv. From the above it follows, (1) That while Cod. א proves the absence from
its exemplar of certain passages, its margin proves the presence of some of them
in a contemporaneous exemplar; (2) that while on the one hand the Eusebian
numbers, coeval with the text, show that the MS. cannot be dated before the
time of Eusebius, on the other hand the form of the text, inasmuch as it is
not arranged so as to suit them, and as it differs from the text implied in them,
marks for it a date little, if at all, after his time—certainly many years earlier
than A.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
v. As regards the omission of the verses of St. Mark xvi. 9-20, it is not correct to
assert that Cod. א betrays no sign of consciousness of their existence. For the
last line of ver. 8, containing only the letters τογαρ, has the rest of the space
(more than half the width of the column) filled up with a minute and elaborate
<span class="tei tei-q">“arabesque”</span> executed with the pen in ink and vermilion, nothing like which
occurs anywhere else in the whole MS. (O. T. or N. T.), such spaces being
elsewhere invariably left blank. By this careful filling up of the blank, the
scribe (who here is the diorthota <span class="tei tei-q">“D”</span>), distinctly shows that the omission
is not a case of <span class="tei tei-q">“non-interpolation,”</span> but of deliberate excision. John Gwynn,

Although Dr. Hort labours to show that no critical inferences ought to be
drawn from this identity of the scribe of Cod. B with the writer of six conjugate
leaves of Cod. א (being three pairs in three distinct quires, one of them containing
the conclusion of St. Mark's Gospel), he is constrained to admit that

book stands first of the Prophetical writings) a column is very naturally left
blank, and two columns at the end of Daniel, with whose prophecy the Old

Eusebius sent to Constantine's new city (Euseb. Vit. Const. Lib. iv) πεντήκοντα
σωμάτια ἐν διφθέραις (c. 36) ... ἐν πολυτελῶς ἠσκημένοις τεύχεσι τρισσὰ καὶ
τετρασσά (c. 37): on which last words Valesius notes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Codices enim membranacei
ferè per quaterniones digerebantur, hoc est quatuor folia simul compacta,
ut terniones tria sunt folia simul compacta. Et quaterniones quidem sedecim
habebant paginas, terniones vero duodenas.”</span> But now that we have come to
know that Cod. B is arranged in quires of five sheets (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg105" class="tei tei-ref">105</a>), that manuscript
will hardly answer to the description τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσά (see p. <a href="#Pg027" class="tei tei-ref">27</a>, note 1)
as Cod. א does. Indeed Canon Cook (Revised Version, &amp;c., p. 162) objects
to Valesius' explanation altogether, on the ground that his sense would rather
require τριπλόα καὶ τετραπλόα, and that the rare words τρισσά (<span class="tei tei-q">“three by three”</span>)
and τετρασσά (<span class="tei tei-q">“four by four”</span>) exactly describe the arrangement of three columns
on a page in Cod. B, and four on a page in Cod. א. The Canon has since
observed that the same view is maintained by O. von Gebhardt (<span class="tei tei-q">“Bibel-text”</span> in
Herzog's Real-Encyklopädie, Leipsic 1878, second edition). On the other hand
Archdeacon Palmer, in an obliging communication made to me, comparing the
words πεντήκοντα σωμάτια ἐν διφθέραις ἐγκατασκεύοις (c. 36) with ἐν πολυτελῶς ἠσκημένοις
τεύχεσιν τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσὰ διαπεμψάντων ἡμῶν, and interpreting Eusebius'
compliance (c. 37) by means of Constantine's directions (c. 36), is inclined to
refer τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσά to σωμάτια, as if it were <span class="tei tei-q">“we sent abroad the collections
[of writings] in richly adorned cases, three or four in a case.”</span> It will probably
be thought that the expression is on the whole too obscure to be depended on for
any controversial purposes. It is safer to argue that if the sections and canons
extant in Cod. א be by a contemporary hand (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></span> p. <a href="#Pg093" class="tei tei-ref">93</a>, and Dean Gwynn's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Memoranda</span></span> in our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Addenda</span></span> for that page), that circumstance, the great antiquity
of the manuscript considered, will confirm the probability of Eusebius' connexion
with it. Eusebius agrees also with א in omitting ἡ πύλη, Matt. vii. 13, and
knew of copies, not however the best or with his approval, which inserted ἡσαΐου
before τοῦ προφήτου in Matt. xiii. 35: א being the only uncial which exhibits
that reading. So again Eusebius after Origen maintains the impossible number
ἑκατὸν ἑξήκοντα of א and a few others in Luke xxiv. 13. Dr. C. R. Gregory, Prolegomena,
pp. 347, 348, inclines to the belief that B and א were among the fifty
MSS. sent by Eusebius to Constantino about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 331-2. Canon Cook's entire
argument (Revised Version of the First Three Gospels (1882), pp. 160-165) should

with Stephen's β´. No other manuscript has been discovered which agrees with
β´ in the many singular readings and arbitrary additions in support of which it
is cited by Stephen. That he omitted so many more than he inserted is no
argument against their identity, since we know that he did the same in the
case of his α´ (the Complutensian Polyglott) and η´ (Codex L, Paris 62). The
great inaccuracy of Stephen's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">margin</span></em> (the text is much better revised) is so
visible from these and other well-ascertained instances that no one ought to
wonder if β´ is alleged occasionally (not often) for readings which D does not
contain. On a careful analysis of all the variations imputed to β´ by Stephen,
they will be found to amount to 389 in the parts written in the original hand,
whereof 309 are alleged quite correctly, forty-seven a little loosely, while in eight
instances corrected readings are regarded in error as from the original scribe.
Of the twenty-five places which remain, all but three had been previously discovered
in other copies used by Stephen, so that β´ in their case has been
substituted by mistake for some other numeral. One of the three remaining
has recently been accounted for by Mr. A. A. Vansittart, who has found καὶ
περισσευθήσεται added to δοθήσεται αὐτῷ (Luke viii. 18 from Matt. xiii. 12) in
Stephen's θ´ or Coislin 200 at Paris (No. 38, of the Gospels). I do not find β´
cited by Stephen after Acts xx. 24, except indeed in Rom. iii. 10 (with α´), in
manifest error, just as in the Apocalypse xix. 14 ε´ (No. 6 of the Gospels), which
does not contain this book, is cited instead of ιε´; or as ια´ is quoted in xiii. 4,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but not elsewhere in the Apocalypse</span></em>, undoubtedly in the place of ιϛ´; or as ιϛ´, which
had broken off at xvii. 8, reappears instead of ιε´ in xx. 3. In the various places
named in the last note, wherein the Greek of Cod. D is lost, β´ is cited only at
Matt. xxvii. 3, beyond question instead of η´; and for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">part</span></em> of the reading in
Acts ix. 31, δ´ (to which the whole rightly belongs) being alleged for the other
part. In John xix. 6, indeed, where the original Greek is missing, β´ is cited,
but it is for a reading actually extant in the modern hand which has there
supplied Codex D's defects.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_169" name="note_169" href="#noteref_169">169.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ils s'emparèrent des portes et de tous les lieux forts ... non pas sans leur

He was not the man to be at all ashamed of spoiling the Philistines,

The second stanza intimates that as the pilgrimage to Rome is at the risk of
life, it is folly not to be at peace with Christ before we set out. The opening
words <span class="tei tei-q">“To come to Rome”</span> imply that the verses were written there by some
disappointed pilgrim. Since the handwriting resembles that of the interlinear
Latin, Mr. King suggests that both may have been the work of the Scottish
Bishop Marcus, or of his nephew Moengal (Rettig, Cod. Δ, Prolegomena, p. xx),
who called at St. Gall on their return from Rome, whence Marcus went homewards,

connected with their respective Latin versions, and because F contains no trace
of the vacant lines left in G at the end of Rom. xiv to receive ch. xvi. 25-27.
But Dr. Hort (Journal of Philology, vol. iii. No. 5, pp. 67, 68 note) has come
to think that F is a mere transcript of G, the scribe of the former being by far
the more ignorant of the two. He meets our argument to the contrary stated
above in the text, by alleging that in respect to the division of words F is free
from no outrageous portent found in G, while it has to answer for many of its
own. But (to take our examples from one open leaf) if the writer of F were so
helplessly ignorant as Dr. Hort represents, how could he have set right G's
error in 1 Tim. iv. 7, reading και · γραωδεις for G's και αιγραωδεις? Again, if F had
before him an undivided manuscript, one can easily account for such monsters
as in 1 Tim. iv. 2 και · καυτη ριασ μενων· F (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">photographed page</span></span>), but no one could
possibly have so written with G's κεκαυτηριασμενων before him. That the two
copies were compared together in after times seems evident from the fact stated
in p. 179, that Latin renderings from G stand in eighty-six places above the
Greek of F. It was at the same time perhaps that some ill-divided words in F

1 Pet. iii. 11 we know to be R. Stephen's of 1550) by Petro Faxardo, Marquis of
Velez, a Spaniard, who had taken them from sixteen manuscripts, eight of
which were in the king's library, in the Escurial. It is never stated what
codices or how many support each variation. De la Cerda had received the
readings from Mariana, the great Jesuit historian of Spain, then lately dead,
and appears to have inadvertently added to Mariana's account of their origin,
that the sixteen manuscripts were in Greek. These Velesian readings, though
suspected from the first even by Mariana by reason of their strange resemblance
to the Latin Vulgate and the manuscripts of the Old Latin, were repeated as
critical authorities in Walton's Polyglott, 1657, and (contrary to his own better
judgement) were retained by Mill in 1707. Wetstein, however (N. T. Proleg.
vol. i. pp. 59-61), and after him Michaelis and Bp. Marsh, have abundantly
proved that the various readings must have been collected by Velez from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em>
manuscripts, and by him translated into Greek, very foolishly perhaps, but not
of necessity with a fraudulent design. Certainly, any little weight the Velesian
readings may have, must be referred to the Latin, not to the Greek text.

the following establish the fact beyond the possibility of doubt:

critical authorities, though for a different reason. The collection of various readings
from twenty-two manuscripts (ten of the Gospels, eight of the Acts and
Epistles, and four of the Apocalypse), seen by Isaac Vossius in 1642 in the
Barberini Library at Rome, was made about 1625, and first published in 1673 by
Peter Possinus (Poussines), a Jesuit, at the end of a catena of St. Mark. He
alleged that the collations were made by John M. Caryophilus [d. 1635], a Cretan,
while preparing an edition of the Greek Testament, under the patronage of Paul V
[d. 1621] and Urban VIII [d. 1644]. As the Barberini readings often favour the
Latin version, they fell into the same suspicion as the Velesian: Wetstein
especially (N. T. Proleg. vol. i. pp. 61, 62), after pressing against them some
objections more ingenious than solid, declares <span class="tei tei-q">“lis haec non aliter quam ipsis
libris Romae inventis et productis, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quod nunquam credo fiet</span></em>, solvi potest.”</span> The very
papers Wetstein thus called for were discovered by Birch (Barberini Lib. 209)
more than thirty years later, and besides them Caryophilus' petition for the
loan of six manuscripts from the Vatican (Codd. BS, 127, 129, 141, 144), which he
doubtless obtained and used. The good faith of the collator being thus happily
vindicated, we have only to identify his eleven [Cod. 141 of the Gospels being also
Act. 75, Paul. 86, Apoc. 40. Another of his manuscripts was Act. 73, Paul. 80.]

many of his critical materials accumulated for the illustrious Bentley are

illegible scrawl between the Latin column in the post of honour on the left, and
the Greek column on the right, has been ascertained by Mr. B. H. Alford (who
